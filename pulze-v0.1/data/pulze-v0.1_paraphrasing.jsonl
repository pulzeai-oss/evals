Rewrite and paraphrase the following paragraph for metehara state farm, ethiopia without changing the nomenclature without losing citation and references \n\nThere are longstanding concerns that freshwater resources are insufficient to satisfy the increasing demand from various segments of human society. However, water allocation is slanted towards industry and domestic use primarily due to their economic benefits. Therefore, a dwindling agricultural water supply due to inadequate allocation is becoming a barrier to agriculture and husbandry in some parts of the world, even areas where farming lifestyles have been dominant for hundreds of years. Agricultural regions with arid climates such as the Nile basin in Egypt and Syria suffer from additional water stress due to an imbalance between ET and precipitation, usually leading to over-exploitation of aquifers and even water-related conflicts [1,2]. involved planting young trees led to an approximate 25% increase in water consumption. Overall, since 2012, the water-saving project has achieved satisfactory performance regarding excessive groundwater withdrawal, showing a reduction trend of 3 million m3/year and an increase in Lake Aiding water levels since 2011. The results reveal the potential of the ET monitoring strategy as a basis for basin-scale water management.\nGlobally, the spatial inhomogeneity of water resources is primarily affected by climate, which is difficult to change with human action. However, local and regional water management and re-allocation could be conducted to match the local topography and land surface patterns to better utilize water storage and runoff patterns [3]. Studies to optimize water allocation have been proposed worldwide and are available to policy makers [4–8]. In addition to guiding water into appropriate areas, advanced irrigation technology (e.g., sprinkler and drip) can be applied to improve water use efficiency (WUE) by reducing non-beneficial soil consumption [9,10]. However, inadequate allocation and irrigation programmes provide no water-saving guarantees because they typically fail to consider the hydrological cycle as a whole system [11]. The relationship between water consumption dynamics in water-saving measures should also be considered. In reality, both systematic designation and stepwise policy optimization through monitoring are required.\nWater conservation projects have been proposed to save water from several aspects, especially in the arid north-western areas of China. Except for dams built to store floodwater for the dry season, investments in China have mainly targeted improved water delivery infrastructure and irrigation technologies. However, these measures may not always achieve a reduction of real water consumption from crops [12]. Optimized infrastructure can greatly reduce percolation but provide no guarantee of real water saving. This approach simply allocates reduced water resources to specific uses. In fact, overall water consumption in a basin may even increase ET and exacerbate the water scarcity. It is easy to imagine a scenario in which growing high-value crops, such as fruit, becomes easier with sufficient water supply provided by the improved drainage and irrigation system, resulting in increased total water consumption due to the expansion of fruit cultivation. In some regions, a reduced water supply might be more susceptible to contamination by saline aquifer or runoff into the sea [11]. Due to the outmoded management strategies, in some parts of China, surface and groundwater over-exploitation resulting from irrigated agriculture has led to ecosystem deterioration [13]. Thus, conservation projects require both adoption and constant optimization with assistance from timely monitoring results to achieve true water savings.\nRemote sensing (RS) images can provide spatially distributed, time-series data of the earth’s surface at diverse resolutions and have been proven to be a reliable source for monitoring water consumption [14–16]. Researchers worldwide have designed satellite-based ET models with satisfactory reliability [10,17,18]. Over the past decade, management and allocation projects have capitalized on satellite-based ET monitoring to relieve water stress [19–21]. Anderson lists several applications that employ moderate-resolution ET maps (30-m) to reflect the ecosystem response to\nwater management [22]. In addition, an Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model has been used to monitor water consumption in two American regions, including the Palo Verde Irrigation District, which has an arid climate [23,24]. The results show that there is a high correlation between total water consumption and human activity, especially with respect to irrigation in arid regions. ET from local plants consumes approximately 70% of total terrestrial rainfall [11]. Therefore,\nwater consumption by vegetation should be effectively controlled and managed. However, due to differences in surface conditions, no universally applicable monitoring strategy exists. For example, large homogeneous farmland areas (over 100 ha) are rare in northwest China, which usually causes RS pixels to be mixed. Therefore, the 4-km pixels from reference ET data are not fine grained enough to reveal ET spikes after local irrigation [24]. Moreover, developing a unified spatial resolution of an ET map that is suitable for analysis from different aspects is impractical. Data with low spatial resolution are available at higher frequencies and over longer time series, but responses from ecosystems and human society to the water-saving policy are necessary to maintain a sustainable cycle,\nwhich could be monitored by more detailed analysis. Therefore, an integrated ET monitoring strategy should be designed and conducted considering different monitoring tasks and their corresponding resolution requirements.\nIn this study, an ET monitoring approach that uses two spatial resolutions was designed for the Turpan Oasis, which has an extremely arid climate. Since 2006, the region has experienced farmland expansion due to policy and migration from other provinces. In late 2011, the local government began investing in a water protection project, and drastic variations in agricultural and ecological policies make this area a valuable case study for water management monitoring. The main objectives of this study were: (a) to evaluate the monitoring strategy’s performance in an extremely arid region using data from 2006 to 2016; (b) to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics by employing validated ET results; (c) to summarize the agriculture and ecological responses to the water-saving policy; and (d) to assess the successes and challenges in current ET monitoring strategy. Section 2 introduces the methods and data involved in this study. Section 3 presents ET simulation results and a detailed analysis based on ET monitoring. Section 4 provides a discussion of the entire monitoring study. Conclusions and a summary of the study are presented in Section 5.", "subject": "paraphrasing", "answer": "Persistent worries exist about the sufficiency of freshwater resources to meet the growing needs of various human sectors.

This imbalance often results in over-exploitation of groundwater and even water-related conflicts.\n\nA water-saving project in Metehara, Ethiopia has shown promising results in addressing excessive groundwater withdrawal, with a reduction trend of 3 million m3/year and an increase in Lake Aiding water levels since 2011. This was achieved through the planting of young trees, which led to a 25% increase in water consumption.

After the AD 106 Roman conquest of the area, the place was known as Municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napoca.\n\n“Several fragments of a Roman road were found, covered with slabs and built of river stones, sometimes glued with mortar, at a depth of about 80 cm. The orientation of the road is north-south, and it is probably related to the street network of the Roman settlement of Napoca,” archaeologist Cristian Dima from the National History Museum of Transylvania told Agerpres.\nAccording to Cristian Dima, the roads made by the Romans were used for a long time after the fall of the Roman Empire, and some are still used today, at least as their route. In fact, many of today’s roads preserve at least the course of the roads from 2,000 years ago.\n\n“Roman roads, like in everything that was the Roman Empire, were reused after the fall of the empire. There are many examples in Italy, Via Apia, etc. They are reused. In our country, the Middle Ages begin somewhere in the 14th century, in Cluj, with the foundation of the citadel. Of course, the Austrians reused them in their period, after that the street layout and today’s layout is still preserved, more or less, as it was in the Roman period. Several roads are identified, both in the Roman civil settlements and in the military settlements, in particular. In Alba, many roads are discovered, right in the area of ​​the XIII Gemina castle, in Turda, a few more roads are discovered. The imperial road that we, those from the Cluj Museum, discovered during the excavations in 2021, on the highway route, the road discovered in the area of ​​the Roman fort at Sutor, etc.“, the archaeologist from Cluj also said.\n“Part of the Roman road networks/routes are still preserved today,” Cristian Dima said, adding that this is especially true in rural areas. “In larger cities, where there are more interventions, these are not kept exactly. Between localities, mostly the same routes are used. In Transylvania, where the Habsburg and Austro-Hungarian Empires were, they did a lot of construction works, many of them were modified.”\n\nHe emphasized that the strength and durability of roads and other structures built by the Romans derive from their later reuse and maintenance, as well as the Roman technology that was developed for the time.\n“They had quite advanced technology for the time. […] A fairly solid structure was made, with large stones at the base, then with small stones and then large slabs at the top, more or less processed. Feleac tiles, some of them rounded, were used in Cluj. On a smaller scale, it closely resembles what is preserved today in Pompeii,” Cristian Dima explained.\n\nThe Roman roads were notable for their straightness, solid foundations, cambered surfaces that aided drainage, and the use of concrete made of pozzolana (volcanic ash) and lime. Roman roads were very quick and safe to travel large distances.\n\nWhen ancient Romans built something, it was meant to last. Countless examples clearly show why historians and archaeologists often refer to ancient Romans as famous builders who left behind many bridges, aqueducts, canals, stone-paved roads, and other engineering masterpieces all throughout the Roman Empire. \"\n\n\"The vast Roman Empire boasted a large and extensive network of roads. It is estimated that the roads in the network were more than 400,000 km long and over 80,500 km out of those were stone-paved. The road network was important in maintaining the stability of the empire and its expansion.\" \nDiscovering ancient Roman roads is important to scientists as they give a better understanding of Europe's history. A while back, archeologists unearthed a well-preserved ancient road that offers evidence Romans moved much deeper into Wales than historians previously thought.\n\n\"For some reason, the road had been completely missed, but knowing about its existence will shed new light on Roman’s presence in Britain.\" 2 \n\nArchaeologists in the UK have also stumbled upon a hidden 2,000-year-old Roman road that could be of ‘global importance.’ By mapping newly unearthed ancient Roman roads with the ones discovered earlier, scientists can eventually improve their understanding of movement across the European continent at the peak of the Roman Empire and even after it fell.\n\nArchaeologists in Romania now report they, too, have unearthed an ancient Roman road that is still in excellent condition. The 2,000-year-old road was discovered in Cluj-Napoca, a city in northwestern Romania, the Transylvania region's unofficial capital.\n\"Several fragments of a Roman road were found, covered with slabs and built of river stones, sometimes glued with mortar, at a depth of about 80 cm. The orientation of the road is north-south and is probably connected to the city's street network Roman Napoca\", archaeologist, Cristian Dima from the National History Museum of Transylvania, told Agerpres, the National News Agency of Romania.\n\nAccording to Dima, many ancient Roman roads were used long after the fall of the Roman Empire and some are still used today.\n\n\"Roman roads were reused after the empire's fall, just like everything else left by ancient Romans.

The resistance of Roman constructions is also due to the mortar they invented then, but also their subsequent reuse, through which those who reused them took care to preserve them\", the archaeologist from Cluj explains.\n\nOne of the reasons ancient Romans still last is because very resistant concrete was used for the construction.

This tragedy is Covid-19.\n\n \n\n During this time, there might be a stream of negative news, which might make you overwhelmed and worried. You have the choice to pick whether you want to look at a problem with a positive attitude and take it as a challenge or a negative attitude and worry about it. It is all up to you.\nOptimism or pessimism?\n\nOptimism means to look at problems on the bright side. There's ALWAYS a bright side to problems, no matter how big the problem is. You might think, covid-19 is more than just a big problem. It’s a huge problem. Millions of people died from this disease around the world. If you want a change in life, you have to be the change. Like Mohandas Gandhi said “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” \nCovid-19 has helped me discover the optimism within me because it helped see the bright side of problems, something that can be really hard to do. Because of covid-19, we had to stay at home. Parents had to work from home, and kids had to learn from home. But since everyone was at home, there was more family time, and everyone got to know each other just a bit better. Even if we all go to school in person now, you can’t go somewhere too far away, as there could be a risk of you getting the disease. Because of this, now we get more family time.\n\n I am going to use the optimism that covid-19 has given me to achieve the goals that I have for the future. I am going to use the optimism covid-19 has given to help with tests, and make grades go up. I can achieve anything with optimism and so can everyone in this world.

A fresh Windows 11 install from a USB stick automatically pulls down a range of third-party apps from the Microsoft Store the first time you connect to the Internet, and Windows includes plenty of Microsoft house ads for Edge, Bing, Microsoft Start, Microsoft 365, OneDrive, and other products and features.\nMicrosoft's landing page for the feature says the apps will appear during searches and in the Apps and Gaming tabs within the app. Developers will be able to track whether and where users see the ads and whether they're downloading and opening the apps once they see the ads.\n\nReach the right customers at the right time with your games and apps\nContent is at the heart of the Windows PC experience. Consumers typically visit the Microsoft Store to learn more about a wide variety of PC apps or games, from productivity apps that accelerate work to creativity apps that empower innovation, games that incentivize connection, and more. Because most consumers live a multi-screen life—moving from smartphones to PCs and back again—the lines between “mobile” and “desktop” have blurred. In turn, the behaviors consumers are accustomed to on mobile are transferable to the way people expect apps on PCs to look, feel, and function. Developers know that apps are central to how we work, play, and connect. And the great news is PC apps are having their moment. From the pandemic accelerating PC use to app-savvy millennial and Gen-Z audiences growing up creating and using apps—a wide audience is looking for app-centric experiences, not only on mobile, but on PCs, too.\n\nReach a wider app audience with Microsoft Store Ads\n\nOur passion for helping developers more easily bring their apps to customers inspired us to redesign the Microsoft Store on Windows—which now features a new desktop app distribution experience that looks and feels more like mobile. Now, when customers visit the Microsoft Store, they can download apps for either mobile or PC.\n\nWith Microsoft Store Ads, developers now have new app discoverability opportunities on Windows. Microsoft Store Ads is all desktop traffic, with mission-driven users that have a high intent to download a desktop app. The opportunity is vast; 2022 was a record year, with over 900 million unique users worldwide utilizing the Microsoft Store, and a 122% year-over-year increase in developer submissions of new apps and games.\n\nMicrosoft Store Ads was designed to help developers grow their business by getting their apps or games in front of the right customers at the right time, and to inspire Microsoft Store customers with great content. A developer of a music-making app, for example, will be able to create an ad campaign to get their app in front of an audience that likes music or likes to create music.\n\nWhether you’re about to launch a brand-new app or have a 2.0 bug update for an app currently on the Windows Store, developers can now advertise right on the Microsoft Store, to incentivize people to install or update.\n\nAll developers are welcome\nWe are now offering a new set of Open App Store Principles that welcome all developers to bring the best apps and games to Windows 11 devices, from apps using their own commerce to third-party storefronts. And last year, we announced a waitlist program for Win32 apps in Microsoft Store and welcomed hundreds of developers. Today, we are pleased to share that the program is now open to all Win32 developers (.NET, C++, Electron, Flutter, Qt, Rust, and more). If your app or game is not in the Microsoft Store yet, begin by publishing your Windows app.\n\nAll developers have access to Microsoft Store Ads, where they can create ad campaigns in the Microsoft Store, using Microsoft Advertising, reaching customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. However, only developers with published content on the Store will be able to run ad campaigns, which ensures ads are contextual for customers.\n\nGet started today\nMicrosoft Store Ads is built for apps already on Windows—and for your latest release. Now is the time to promote and invest in your desktop app. Having just announced ads on the Microsoft StoreOpens in new window, the costs per click (CPC) are very competitive, which can bring your overall cost per action (CPA) down.\n\nWe recommend developers reach out to their marketing team to create a strategic app marketing plan leveraging Microsoft Store Ads. Let the team know that with Microsoft Store Ads you promote your desktop app to customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices by creating ads on the Microsoft Advertising platform. Once created, developers will see their app advertised live right on the Microsoft Store. Customers will click the ad, download or update the app to their PC, and let the writing, playing, or gaming come to life.", "subject": "paraphrasing", "answer": "Hey there! You know how sometimes you search for an app on the Microsoft Store, and you get a bunch of relevant results? Well, Microsoft just launched something called Microsoft Store Ads, which basically means developers can now pay to have their apps show up first when you're searching for something else. It's like they're saying, \"Hey, forget about what you were actually looking for, check out this app instead!\"\n\nMicrosoft is pretty excited about this whole thing. They're saying 2022 was a record year for the Microsoft Store, with over 900 million unique users worldwide and a whopping 122% increase in developers submitting new apps and games. They've been making it easier for all kinds of apps to be on the Store, including traditional Win32 apps and even Android apps through their partnership with Amazon.\n\nNow, Microsoft has been testing these ads since September 2022, and they're finally ready to roll them out to everyone. The ads will show up for Windows 10 and Windows 11 users, but only developers who have already published their apps on the Store can create ad campaigns.\n\nMicrosoft says these ads are a way for developers to boost their work and find more users, but let's be real – if it's anything like the ads on Apple's platforms, we might end up seeing a lot of irrelevant, annoying, or even malicious ads. I mean, do we really need to see ads for Twitter or Truth Social when we're just trying to find a Mastodon client?\n\nAnd let's not forget, Windows already has plenty of ads as it is. When you do a fresh install of Windows 11, it automatically downloads a bunch of third-party apps from the Microsoft Store, and there are ads for all sorts of Microsoft products like Edge, Bing, OneDrive, and more.\n\nBut hey, at least developers will be able to track how many people are seeing their ads and downloading their apps. That's something, right?\n\nSo, what do you think? Are you excited about seeing more ads in the Microsoft Store, or do you think it's just going to make finding the apps you actually want even more of a hassle? Let me know in the comments below!"}
