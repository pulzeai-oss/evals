In addition, there is the need for differentiation from competing pharma brands.\n\nInditech's solutions represent a win-win opportunity, wherein brands can partner with Inditech for their therapy areas. They can become the distribution or promotion partners for Inditech's services for the doctors/clinics they target. They can also become the recruitment partner for specialists in a specific therapy area, for a region. This helps them to bring high and differentiated value to the doctors.

Consistent pronunciation:\n   - Simple phonetic system with a limited number of sounds\n   - Each letter represents only one sound\n   - Stress falls on the second-to-last syllable of a word\n   - No silent letters or complex consonant clusters\n\n4.
