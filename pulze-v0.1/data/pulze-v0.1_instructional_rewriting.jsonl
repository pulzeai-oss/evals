{"question": "Rewrte this for clarity:\nRaising the bar, even if just a bit, is a good thing. My stance is that the principles of good security should apply irrespective of a company’s growth phase. ‘Good security’ is usually commensurate with a company’s risk posture and tolerance. Some controls are dictated by headquarters locations, industry verticals, or fiduciary responsibilities. But for the most part, the work necessary to define a level of acceptance for certain types of threats and vulnerabilities just doesn’t take place. Fortunately, modern compliance frameworks are starting to recognize this and include it into their frameworks.", "subject": "instructional_rewriting", "answer": "Good security is essential for companies in any growth phase.

{"question": "Take this story and improve it. Keep the story the same but give describe the surroundings, feelings, and thoughts more meaningfully to paint a picture in a person's mind with your words.\n\nThe origin story of the Duulo-Vraktor bloodline has been passed down for generations. It all started with Mitne, a dragon deity with glossy rainbow scales. He was the guardian of the forest and kept the natural balance. Mitne had long transcended past pride many years before time or history was a concept. For this reason, he regarded everything in the forest as his equal and took his time building meaningful friendships with all life. \n\nElves, often being a very traditional race, lived in harmony with the forest and their friend. Many generations of elves learned much from Mitne and he cherished the elves' sincerity and mistakes in their short lives of around 750 years which to him was like the blink of an eye. All they had ever known was peace as far as they could remember. \n\nThose who stumbled onto the forest would be in natural awe of Mitne and those who came with bad intentions had their hearts purified at the sight of him and their souls soothed when he spoke to them. For the first time, those people felt the shadows in their heart lifted, seeing the world with fresh eyes. Finally they could hear nature's timeless song: the gentle wind that makes the grass whistle, a drop of dew falling from the leaf of a tree onto a rock and dirt, the dancing leaves and petals as they fell and were swept up again. One sobbing person worked up all his strength to ask Mitne, \"I have done much evil for the sake of my own greed and lust. I came to plunder your forest yet your presence lifted all the clouds in me, like I am a newborn again. How have you done this?\"\n\nMitne never looked away from the man. He always listened mindfully. The great dragon closed his eyes not to ponder the question for he knew the answer. He just listened to nature's timeless song for a moment longer with the man. \"Thank you.\", said the man.\n\nMitne replied, \"I gave you a taste of the essence of true divinity. If there is still some good in one's heart then it cleanses all impurities. True evil is very rare. If no goodness is left in a creature, then darkness will attempt to consume the divinity and fail. Darkness promises power and when it's overwhelmed by the light, which is the very thing it abandoned for power it will cause the mind to go mad from fear and die. In these cases I cleanse the souls and they enter the cycle of rebirth.\"\n\nThe man had just been given insight into the great order and broke down crying.\n\n\"You have grasped the true weight of your own guilt. Your tears are a testament to your sincerity as you mourn the futures of others that you took. Punishment is not the answer to atonement. Live by finding your own path to divinity.\"\n\n\"Where do I start?\"\n\n\"Anywhere. Fill the world with flowers so that others may hear nature's timeless song as you have today.\"\n\nHe had found his resolve and walked onward without looking back out of respect for Mitne. He knew Mitne regarded him as a friend, something he never imagined could happen before that day, so he went out to become someone worthy of the trust of a real friend.\n\nMany tribes had populated the forest over many centuries. One day Mitne went to each tribe to announce he was leaving. The news was really sudden. There was no great conflict or grand reason. He just said it was time to go. He told everyone, when he goes, the egg of his nextborn will be created. The day of departure came and everyone made a circle around his favorite resting spot and smiled so the last thing he would see before returning to the gods would be joy in the faces of all his friends. \n\nHe knew how their hearts truly wept. He was honored, his last words: \"I am always with you all, my dear friends.\" \n\nTime and space twisted and distorted and flashed and he was gone leaving a rainbow scaled egg behind.\n\nA young prodigious diviner forth saw the hatching of the next forest guardian was to be on the very next day.\n\nBy the egg's will, only the youth from all life of the forest had been summoned to come that night to witness the awakening. As the sun set and the moon reached its peak on the starry, black canvas, the young diviner strummed her harp, the youth played their forest flutes, and the forest creatures howled, and roared, and watched as the egg slowly cracked and a beautiful, colossal creature emerged. \n\nEveryone went silent. The new rainbow dragon looked around at every creature for a while and finally broke the silence with a greeting.\n\n\"I am Duulo.\" \n\nAs a diety, Duulo was born with great knowledge of himself, his name, and his purpose. Mitne's rainbow scales would sparkle poetically from each of the sun ray's kisses, while Duulo appeared to shine his own hue beside the moonlight.\n\n\"My father has kept this forest in a state of everlasting peace for as long as it has existed. The creatures of the forest are strong and many beyond this forest have been saved and feel indebted to my father. His gift to his friends was the strength to overcome your own battles. I will guide you to fully realizing that strength but your battles are your own to fight. So youth of this forest, you all will one day set out to see this world and grow in a new way, so hone your path until then. Carry on this message after you make your way back home.\"\n\nAs the sun rose Duulo curled up and went to sleep.\n\nHis message came as a surprise to many in the forest. The diviners confirmed that if the forest didn't prepare and heed Duulo's words that for the first time in their history they would not be ready for the battles to come.\n\nDuulo woke up every night and many came to him for advice. Trade opened up to the neighboring villages and kingdoms. The artisans, great sorcerers, bards, storytellers and many more built up great influence. \n\nThe young diviner prodigy watched the moon every night while strumming her harp and Duulo would join her. This continued for hundreds of years. The forest and it's folk had succeeded and grown. Finally it was time for all the youth to set out.\n\nDuulo told that it too was his time to go, that the forest was now in the hands of it's creatures.\n\nThe young prodigious diviner was named Ernaya. She was blind from birth but saw the world through various futures because of her gift. Duulo has been quietly in love with her for centuries. He would not be bound by divine duty. Although many dragons are splendid shapeshifters, Duulo did something even Ernaya nor even the heavens could foresee, he reincarnated as a mortal, freeing himself from his duty. He also healed Ernaya's eyes and changed her fate. They went on countless adventures together. Duulo never hid who he was. The forest people came to accept Duulo's choice and love for Ernaya. Their family name became known as the Duulo-Vraktor with a lineage that lives to this day. Elves of Duulo's blood continue the pilgrimage that their ancestors once took, seeking their own answers to freedom. The dragon blood manifests itself at it's prime in those who discover the price that freedom comes at and their children are also blessed with strong dragon blood as well.\n\nNot everyone returns, but in honoring this tradition none regret seeking the answer.", "subject": "instructional_rewriting", "answer": "The forest where Mitne resided was a sanctuary of vibrant life and colors.

His presence exuded a sense of ancient wisdom and tranquility, his eyes reflecting the depth of his understanding and compassion for all living beings in the forest.\n\nThe elves, with their pointed ears and graceful movements, lived in perfect harmony with the forest and Mitne. Their homes were woven into the trees, blending seamlessly with nature. They moved with an air of reverence around Mitne, their actions filled with respect and gratitude for the guardian of their home.\n\nWhen outsiders stumbled into the forest, they were met with a sense of awe and wonder at the sight of Mitne. His mere presence had a transformative effect on them, washing away their dark intentions and filling them with a newfound sense of peace and clarity. The man who came seeking to plunder the forest found himself cleansed of his greed and lust, his heart lightened by the divinity that Mitne exuded.\n\nAs Mitne spoke to the man, the forest seemed to hold its breath, the leaves falling in hushed reverence, the animals pausing in their movements to listen. The man's tears were a testament to the weight of his guilt, his soul laid bare before the dragon deity. Mitne's words carried the power of ages, his voice resonating with the truth of his wisdom.\n\nWhen Duulo hatched from his egg, the forest was bathed in the soft glow of the moonlight, the creatures of the forest gathered around in silent awe. His arrival marked a new era for the forest, a time of growth and change. Duulo's words carried the weight of his lineage, his purpose clear and unwavering.\n\nAs Duulo guided the youth of the forest, his presence continued to inspire greatness and courage in those who sought his counsel. The forest flourished under his watchful gaze, the creatures living in harmony and unity.\n\nThe bond between Duulo and Ernaya, the blind diviner prodigy, was a thing of beauty and wonder. Their love transcended boundaries of time and duty, their adventures becoming legend in the forest. The Duulo-Vraktor bloodline became a symbol of freedom and love, their lineage spanning generations and carrying the legacy of their ancestors.\n\nThe forest continued to thrive, its people embarking on journeys of self-discovery and growth. The pilgrimage to seek answers and freedom became a sacred tradition, each traveler honoring the legacy of Duulo and the lessons he imparted.\n\nIn the end, the forest stood as a testament to the power of friendship, love, and the enduring spirit of the Duulo-Vraktor bloodline.

{"question": "Rewrite the email above with a different prhasing. Keep the level of formality.\n\nDear Councilmember [Name],\n\nI would like to add my support as a constituent in [Neighborhood] to a bill that was recently introduced, # Int 0501-2022. This bill would help in the enforcement of blocked bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, which any pedestrian or biker in NYC knows is a massive problem. Blocked lanes and sidewalks are a contributing factor to our deadly traffic problem, forcing bikers and pedestrians into traffic and creating an inconvenience and hazard to everyone else.\n\nI like this bill because it builds off the success of the idling commercial truck laws, which allow citizens to report violations — adding actual consequences to breaking the law and providing an additional revenue stream for the city.\n\nTypically, when we report bike lane blockages via 311, the police response is non-existent and therefore enforcement is non-existent. Many people feel free to use the bike lanes as their personal parking space, and they take advantage of that to the fullest. Allowing citizens to report these blockages directly would show the people of NYC that they can't simply block these lanes and sidewalks without a fine, at a minimum. It would also bring in an underutilized source of revenue for the city at no real additional cost.\n\nIn asking for your support of this bill I would also ask that while the bill is in committee the language is updated to remove the 1320-foot school proximity requirement so that it can be enforced citywide.\n\nI hope we can count on your support for this bill!\n\nThanks, [Name]", "subject": "instructional_rewriting", "answer": "Dear Councilmember [Name],\n\nI am writing to express my support for the recently introduced bill # Int 0501-2022, as a resident of [Neighborhood]. This legislation is crucial for addressing the widespread issue of blocked bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks in NYC, which significantly contribute to the city's traffic fatalities. These obstructions force cyclists and pedestrians into traffic, creating risks and inconveniences for all.\n\nThis bill is commendable as it extends the principles of the successful idling commercial truck laws by enabling citizens to report infractions. This not only holds violators accountable but also opens up a potential revenue stream for the city.\n\nCurrently, reporting blocked bike lanes through 311 often leads to no police action, effectively rendering enforcement null. This has emboldened many to misuse these lanes for parking, fully exploiting this lack of oversight. Direct reporting by citizens would underscore that such behavior will lead to fines, at the very least, and tap into a neglected revenue source without incurring significant additional costs.\n\nI urge you to support this bill and recommend revising its language during the committee stage to eliminate the 1320-foot school proximity restriction, ensuring citywide enforcement.\n\nI look forward to your support on this matter.\n\nThank you, [Name]"}

Messages contain mandatory parameters in a fixed part followed by a list of optional parameters in TLV format. The message type and length are included in the first four bytes of the message, followed by the number of TLVs and the fixed part. The TLV section is divided into the number of TLVs in the header and the list of TLVs after the fixed part.\n\nModel:\nThe HPI service stores a model of network connections in a module called \"model\". The model is updated based on the messages received from USTLO and contains the following data:\n\nSession manager: Maps client IP addresses to client sessions\nClient session: Stores client profiles and a mapping from ports to client connections named \"flow params\"\nFlow params: Stores connection metadata\nConnections (flow params) can be grouped into related connection groups based on criteria such as playback\nFlows:\nA client session starts when the client goes online and ends when the HPI receives notification of the end of the session or enough time has passed. During the session, connections are created and destroyed, and metadata can be updated from USTLO and other services. When a session or connection ends, details are logged in a transaction log.\n\nService Level Agreements:\nThe HPI service should meet the following service level agreements:\n\nAvailability: The HPI service should be available for use by all USTLO workers at all times. The service should be scaled as needed and monitored for health and capacity. In the event of a failure, a new instance of the service will be started as soon as possible. However, it should be noted that a failure of an HPI service can cause the loss of live session and connection data, which may result in default behavior from USTLO.\nResponse Time: The HPI service should respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe, taking into account the processing time for both the HPI service and USTLO.\nError Handling: The HPI service should handle errors and exceptions gracefully and log them for debugging purposes. The service should not propagate errors to USTLO and should be able to handle situations where it receives messages mid-flow.\nCompliance: The HPI service must comply with all relevant regulations and standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA.\nI would like to work on this specification and enhance it, my main focus is detailed description of the underlying architecture and model used. \n\nyour job is to ask me a list of questions that will help me make this spec more robust and detailed \n\n-- here is some additional information \n\nComponents and Interactions:\n\nThe HPI service interacts with the following components:\n\nUSTLO: a high throughput proxy that acts as an entry point for network connections. The HPI service provides business logic to USTLO for managing network connections and communication with other services.\nSPM: a service that provides the HPI service with user profiles, which are used for session management and connection metadata.\nCEMS: a central configuration service that is used to configure all services, including the HPI service.\nSharding and User Sessions:\n\nThe HPI service runs as a sharded cluster, where each HPI instance deals with a subsection of clients connecting to the network through the USTLO proxy. The USTLO proxy is responsible for sharding the users between the available HPIs and notifying the same HPI about events of the same user. Specifically, events about the same user (based on its source IP) should only arrive at one HPI for the duration of the user session.\n\nArchitecture and Design:\n\nThe sharding of the HPI service enables scalability and fault tolerance, as each HPI instance can handle a subset of users and can be independently monitored and scaled. The communication between the HPI service and the other components is based on a custom message format and includes authentication, encryption, and access controls to ensure security and compliance with regulations.\n\nThe SPM service provides user profiles that include information such as user credentials, preferences, and metadata related to the network connections. This information is used by the HPI service to manage user sessions and connection metadata, which are stored in the network connections model. The CEMS service provides configuration information for the HPI service, including parameters such as the maximum message size, supported data types, and error handling mechanisms.\n\nThe sharding and user session management of the HPI service ensure that each HPI instance only receives and processes events related to a subset of users, reducing the processing load and avoiding duplication of events. The HPI service is designed to handle failures and errors gracefully and log them for debugging purposes. Performance metrics and monitoring mechanisms are used to evaluate the performance and health of the HPI service and its interactions with other components.\n-- and some more information \n\nThe USTLO high throughput proxy is a single service that uses multiple workers, each bound to a CPU, to handle network connections. The use of multiple workers ensures that the traffic of a connected client is directed to the same worker, providing consistency and reducing the overhead of communication between workers. The workers are designed to be completely independent from each other, allowing for scalability and fault tolerance.\n\nThe USTLO service includes a dispatcher that routes client packets to the appropriate worker, based on the client's source IP address. This ensures that traffic from a connected client is directed to the same worker throughout the duration of the session, improving performance and reducing latency. The dispatcher also supports load balancing and failover mechanisms, allowing for dynamic allocation of client traffic to available workers.\n\nThe USTLO service is designed to interact with multiple instances of the HPI service, further sharding the client load between the available HPIs. The HPI service provides business logic to USTLO for managing network connections and communication with other services, including session management and connection metadata. The communication between USTLO and the HPI service is based on a custom bi-directional message format and includes mechanisms for authentication, encryption, and access control.\n\n--- and some more info \n\nThe HPI service includes several business logic conditions that can be triggered based on various factors, such as the type of connection, the headers in the request, and the ongoing status of the connection. Some examples of these conditions include:\n\nAdaptive bit rate management: The HPI service analyzes the first packet of a connection, typically the client hello message, to determine the type of connection and classify it to a web service, such as YouTube or Netflix. Based on the user profile, the HPI service notifies USTLO of the network parameters to use for the connection. USTLO then adapts the network conditions for that connection to optimize the user experience.\n\nHeader enrichment: For HTTP connections, USTLO notifies the HPI service with the headers from the request. Based on rules and the client profile, the HPI service can modify the headers and request USTLO to block the connection, forward it to another IP, or send the client a redirect response. This feature enables the HPI service to customize the network behavior based on the client's preferences and requirements.\n\nJust-in-time feature: USTLO periodically sends updates to the HPI service about an ongoing connection. Based on this data, the HPI service calculates specific network parameters to ensure that the client has a specific amount of data in its buffers. This feature is particularly useful for streaming applications, as it reduces data consumption while avoiding stalling and buffering, improving the user experience.\nplease integrate all this info in one coherent and well formatted spec, use markup to mark headers, bullets and lists \nsort out redundencies in the text, and assure well structured clear and understandable language", "subject": "instructional_rewriting", "answer": "I'd be happy to help you refine your technical specification.

I attended Shmiz's wedding on Sunday, where Margo met me there. I was on kratom, gummies and alcohol - quite the combination! Margo sat on the other side of the wall, but she stayed until the end and we hooked up after the event. \n\nThe next day, Uri Levine, the founder of Waze, spoke at the center. I attended his talk and found his perspective on funding and traction intriguing. He had a rather interesting take on the chicken and egg problem, which Waze also faced with their crowdsourcing data model. Uri's attitude towards funding was intriguing; he believes one must \"f*** it\" and find the most passionate people to solve the problem. He seemed rather jaded towards the idea of funding before traction, which made me ponder. \n\nAn interesting encounter happened next. A woman asked Uri about hiring developers, and I chimed in, mentioning that I had a company, albeit not ready to hire. I spoke to her after and exchanged LinkedIn information. I reached out about a potential partnership, but Uri did not respond to my request for a meeting time. I hope he will be a good fit for us, as his expertise would be invaluable. Uri also mentioned a problem he hasn't solved - medical costs in the US, something I have thought about too. I told him I had a solution, but the opportunity to share it passed, and I felt like just another pitch-maker. \n\nDespite the motivating elements of this week, I also felt a deep sense of depression. The prospect of funding and success seemed to evade me. On Wednesday, my mood was extremely low, and I felt down on myself.

{"question": "Please re-write this in a professional, concise yet informative way:\n\nInformed Consent for Therapy Services and Practice Policies:\nI, Fabio Fina, MSW, LCSW, am a licensed clinical social worker in the state of Colorado (License # CSW.09926963). I received my Master's degree in Social Work from the Metropolitan State University of Denver I hold certifications in trauma therapy (Brainspotting Levels 1 and 2) and am currently studying in a 3-year post-graduate training and receiving supervision in Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) from Jon Frederickson, MSW.\n\nBy signing this document, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the following:\n\n• The therapeutic relationship is a unique and personal contract between us. It has the potential to improve emotional functioning, relationships, self-image, self-esteem, mood, and personal goals. However, some discomfort may be a part of the process and in rare cases, clients have reported feeling worse after therapy.\n• Our sessions will be confidential, however, there are some legal and ethical exceptions to confidentiality that I am required to disclose. These include situations involving child abuse, elder abuse, threats of harm to yourself or others, and court-ordered disclosures.\n• You understand the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the ways in which your protected health information (PHI) may be used for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.\n• You understand that therapy is not a substitute for medical care and that I will recommend seeking medical attention if needed.\n• You have the right to terminate therapy at any time and to request a copy of your records.\n---\nWelcome to your psychotherapy sessions.\n\nYou have taken a positive step by seeking therapy. Participating in individual therapy can benefit you in many ways, such as improving your understanding of personal goals and values, enhancing personal relationships, and resolving specific problems you face. However, it is important to understand that therapy is not a magic solution, and change does not occur overnight.\n\nThe outcome of your treatment will depend largely on your willingness to engage in the process, which may sometimes result in discomfort. Remembering unpleasant events and becoming aware of feelings attached to those events can bring on intense feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, etc. There are no miracle cures, and I cannot promise that your behavior or circumstances will change. The extent to which you are open and honest about yourself will play a role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.\n\nTo prepare for your session, I recommend finding a quiet and private room without interruptions or distractions. Bring paper and a pen, or something to write with. Think of an issue that you would like to bring to our session. I also recommend keeping a journal to write thoughts, questions, reflections, insights, and progress gained through therapy.\n\nTherapy has both benefits and risks. Risks may include experiencing uncomfortable feelings, such as sadness, guilt, anxiety, anger, frustration, loneliness, and helplessness. However, therapy has been shown to benefit individuals who undertake it. Although the majority of people do get better in therapy, some do get worse. Your therapist makes no guarantee of results.\n\nClient rights and important information:\nI am a licensed clinical social worker in the state of Colorado, regulated by the Board of Social Work Examiners, which can be reached at 1560 Broadway, Suite 1350, Denver, Colorado 80202, (303) 894-7766.\n\nAs a licensed professional, I hold a master's degree in social work and have completed two years of post-master supervision.\n\nAs a client, you have the right to:\n\n• Seek a second opinion from another therapist\n• Terminate therapy at any time, with the recommendation of a closure session when possible\n• Receive information about my methods of therapy, techniques used, estimated duration of therapy, and fee structure\nIt is important to note that sexual intimacy between a therapist and client is never appropriate and should be reported to the regulatory board.\n\nExpectations of Therapy:\nWhen you embark on the therapy journey, it's important to understand that change takes time and effort. You have made a positive decision in seeking therapy, but it's important to recognize that it is not a magic cure. As your therapist, I'll be here to support you, but the extent to which you're willing to engage in the process and be open and honest about yourself will play a significant role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.\n\nDuring our therapy sessions, you can expect a combination of psychoeducation and emotional processing. We'll work together to understand the underlying issues that are causing you distress, and the feelings that are attached to those issues. It's normal to experience a range of intense emotions during therapy, such as anger, depression, and anxiety. These are all understandable reactions, and I encourage you to discuss them with me during our sessions. If you find that individual psychotherapy is not the best fit for you, we can explore other options together.\nThe first 2-4 sessions will involve an evaluation of your needs and a discussion of treatment goals. If you have any doubts or questions about working with your therapist, they will be happy to assist you in finding another professional for a second opinion.\nIt is important to remember that therapy results may vary and cannot be guaranteed. It also requires active effort on your part and working on things discussed in therapy outside of sessions.\n\n---\nSession length and attendance:\nTherapy sessions are typically 50 minutes long and held once a week. To achieve the best results, I recommend committing to 3-6 months of treatment. Please arrive on time and notify me if you are unable to make a session. If you miss a session without giving notice, you will be charged for the session. I have a 48-hour cancellation policy, and in case of emergency or my unavailability, I will reschedule the missed session at no additional cost.\n\nNOTE: I consider our first sessions a \"trial-therapy\", meaning that we are learning to get to know each other and our styles. If either of us realizes that our therapeutic connection is not a match, we will discuss ways to move forward, including me referring you to a more appropriate mental health provider.\n\nMissed Appointments and Cancellations:\nTo ensure we can maintain the consistency and progress necessary for therapy, it is important to attend all scheduled sessions and to provide adequate notice for cancellations or changes. If you must miss a session, please contact me at least 48 hours (2 business days) in advance. If less notice is given or if you don't show up without notification, you will be charged for the missed session. In certain cases of emergency or illness, an exception may be made. However, if you miss two or more appointments without notification, treatment may be discontinued. If you have recurring appointments, missing one without notice will result in being charged for that session and rescheduling for the next appointment, but missing a second one without notice will result in cancellation of the recurring appointments unless we make new arrangements.\n\nFees and Payments:\nMy standard fee for therapy sessions is $185 per 50-minute session. Additional fees may apply for couples or group therapy. Payment is expected 48 hours prior to the scheduled session. Payment can be made using a credit or debit card, check, cash or electronic transfer. A $10 service charge will apply for returned checks. You have the option to keep a credit card on file and authorize automatic charging for no-show or late cancellation appointments. My fees are reviewed annually, and I will notify you of any changes at least 30 days before they come into effect. Reduced fee services may be available on a sliding scale, please let me know if this is something that would be beneficial to you.\n\nOther Fees:\nAdditional professional services outside of therapy are charged on a prorated basis.\nThis may include but is not limited to, consultations, report writing, telephone conversations, meetings, or other services requested.\n\nInsurance:\nMy fee for a 50-minute therapy session is $185. I do not accept insurance directly, but I can provide you with a superbill that you can submit to your insurance for reimbursement. It's important to check with your insurance provider to see what your out-of-network benefits are. In case of missed or cancelled appointments, I require a 48-hour notice, and you will be charged for the missed session without proper notice. Payment can be made by debit or credit card, check, cash or electronic transfer, and I have an option for you to keep a credit card on file for automatic charging. If you are unable to pay, we can discuss reduced fee options on a sliding scale. Please be aware that as a standard policy, any additional charges incurred, like consultations or report writing, will be billed at my hourly rate. If payment is in arrears for more than 90 days and a fee payment schedule cannot be agreed upon, your account may be turned over to a collection agency or attorney.", "subject": "instructional_rewriting", "answer": "Fabio Fina, MSW, LCSW, is a licensed clinical social worker in Colorado with extensive training in trauma therapy and intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy.

{"question": "Rewrite the given paragraph in a way that adds more detail, elaboration, and information to the original content, ultimately resulting in a longer and more comprehensive version of the same text. Also divide your revised version into two or more paragraphs if you need to.\n: \"Advantages to renting a home include flexibility, no maintenance costs, fixed housing costs, and access to disposable income for investing that is not available with home ownership. Renting allows the flexibility of moving when your lease ends, or whenever you want if you rent month to month. You could move to another part of town, or to a new city without worrying about selling a home. You are not tied down with a long-term commitment. If you are renting, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance. If something breaks, make a phone call, or send an email and the issue will be corrected. When you rent a home, you have fixed housing costs. Your rent doesn’t fluctuate, you don’t have to budget for repairs or property taxes, and you may not pay utilities. Renting can be more affordable in the short term, as renters don’t have to worry about the initial costs of purchasing a home or paying property taxes. Also, renting may free up disposable income that can be invested to build your financial portfolio (Redfin).\"", "subject": "instructional_rewriting", "answer": "Here is a revised and expanded version of the given paragraph:\n\nRenting a home can offer several distinct advantages compared to homeownership. One of the primary benefits is the flexibility it provides. When you rent, you are not tied down to a single location or property. Your lease typically expires after a fixed period, such as 12 months, allowing you to move to a new area or city without the hassle of selling a home. This mobility can be especially advantageous for individuals who need to relocate for work or simply desire a change of scenery. Additionally, renting eliminates the maintenance responsibilities that come with owning a home. As a tenant, you can simply contact the landlord whenever a repair is needed, and they are responsible for addressing the issue. This frees up your time and resources, as you do not have to worry about budgeting for or coordinating home repairs and upkeep.\n\nAnother significant advantage of renting is the predictability of housing costs. Rent payments are generally fixed, whereas homeownership can involve fluctuating expenses such as property taxes, insurance premiums, and unexpected repair bills. This financial stability can make it easier to create and adhere to a monthly budget. Furthermore, renting may be more affordable, especially in the short term, as it eliminates the substantial upfront costs associated with purchasing a home, such as a down payment, closing costs, and moving expenses. The money saved by renting can then be directed towards building a financial portfolio through investments, rather than being tied up in home equity."}

My strive for innovation and a craving passion to learn more about computer hardware and electronic designs are reasons why I am aspiring to become an Electrical Engineer. Being an individual who enjoys a fast-paced, dynamic environment, I aspire to get involved with a wide variety of projects whilst offering my strong analytical, problem solving, and interpersonal skills. As a third-year Electrical Engineering student, I hope to contribute towards the success of AMD through my actions, academic knowledge, projects, and my experiences inside and outside of university. \nAs a highly dedicated student that is well- accomplished in the fields of customer service and communication capabilities and proficient to the world of technology and administration, I strongly believe that I will have a positive impact towards your company. This is shown though my 4 years of experience as a Retail Associate at McDonalds, 10+ months of experiences as an Administrative Assistant and Support, and through my previous extracurricular experiences. Working at McDonalds helped me develop my coordination and teamworking skills in a fast- paced work environment. My friendly demeanor, coupled with my multitasking abilities, helped me to communicate with customers effectively while placing their orders and cash handling correctly. Moreover, learning to incorporate my organizational and computational skills as an Administrative Assistant and Support help me familiarize myself with reconciling data and organizing it in MS Excel. I strongly believe that my interpersonal and technical skills make me an ideal candidate for the position of Data Centre Power and Performance Co-op Student at AMD.\nMy academic background at Toronto Metropolitan University has been a balanced mix of design projects and theories in which I challenged myself daily to learn about algorithms, data structures, electronics circuit systems and object-oriented engineering analysis and design. During my CPS125 Digital Computation and Programming course, I led a group of 5 students in analyzing and creating unique algorithms to solve large information filling systems problems. I was responsible in facilitating team meetings, completing the final project report, and assisting with research and developing a binary search algorithm to satisfy specific conditions provided by the problem. This 4-week project provided me with the opportunity to work with a group of like-minded individuals and utilize my analytical skills to solve problems and showcase my project management skills. During the quarantine in 2021, I took the initiative to complete the CS50 Series Course by Harvard University to learn various programing languages. Using the knowledge from this course, I was able to develop my own version of Black- Jack, Tic Tac Toe, and Hangman using Java and Python. During the winter 2022 semester, I was able to develop a merge sort algorithm (garbage collection included) with C using the knowledge learned from data structures and linked lists.\nThanks to my academic background in electronics and my hands on experience using lab hardware such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers, knowledge regarding analog/digital circuit analysis, reading schematics, software architecture, design and debugging, concept regarding power and performance are a few things I crave to learn more about. Additionally, being part of Toronto Met Formula Racing gave me an insight into hardware engineering and gaining technical experience by engaging with other sub-team members within the electrical drivetrain sub-team.\nOverall, I am confident that I will easily transition into the role of Data Centre Power and Performance Co-op Student and effectively contribute to the engineering team at AMD. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you personally and arrange a time to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your time and consideration.

{"question": "How can I improve how I showcase Koa in the following essay? \n\n[Koa Runnels, where do we even start with this one. 22 and confused? Misdirected or Unmotivated? What direction is he willing to stick with to make his life satisfying? Koa’s life is a complicated one to say nonetheless. Even though he has a short life compared to many, he went through quite a journey so far. He still figuring things out as he gets older and still trying to find out who he is. He came to a conclusion recently and finally realized he never made a decision truly for himself. He did what others felt was best for him, and he always went along because he didn’t want to make waves. Not anymore, he’s determined to be his own person. Let’s take a look at a few experiences and piece them together to try to understand his fast-paced and confusing life.]\nBorn on March 30, 1999, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Koa entered the world. For the first six years and one week of his life, he lived in North Carolina. Then suddenly, a week after he just turned six. He, his three older sisters, and his mother are heading for Oahu. And for the next sixteen years, he lived up and down the west coast of Oahu. You could say it was exactly the same with his life. “But to be honest whose isn’t?” Koa says as he starts to think back on how he lived his life. How the choices \nIt all starts on April 6, 2005, the day that marked where everything changed for the young man. His mother announced to him and his three sisters. He was all for it. They took a trip the year prior to visit his aunt and his grandma. It was his first-ever trip, and no less it was Christmas time when they went. So looking forward to going back so quickly on another “vacation” there was exciting.\nAt such a young age he didn’t understand what was really going on. He wondered why his dad was the one dropping us off and why he was so sad. He saw that his sisters were sad as well, so he felt sad too not knowing why. It wasn’t until a week in he realized that his father wouldn’t be joining them. “I and your father are getting divorced,” His mother told him. Little did he know at such a young age what those words meant. It wouldn’t be long to feel the strain of being different from those who had both parents. Persistently being asked, “where is your dad? why don’t you have a dad?” and all the while Koa didn’t know how to answer them in the slightest. To get away from this, he remembers always going to the health room. Almost every week he’d go at least twice, His health room card almost being as thick as a small book by the end of the year. He wasn’t sick at all, he didn’t want to be bothered by anyone. Truth was, this young man was experiencing depression. And with such adverse effects at a young age, it was hard for him to open up. \nThat wasn’t the only trial he faced. Coming from a more southern area along with having an accent, and being one of the fairest kids at school, he felt even isolated. One of the worst experiences was between him and a classmate. “Hey, that’s a nice flag drawing you got in your binder, what country is that?” Koa ask. “Yeah, I drew it, and it’s from the Philippines.” His classmate replies. Coming from a mixed ethnic family, Koa thought this be a good chance to make another friend with similar interests. “Really? I’m Filipino too! I got Illicano and Visayan.” Koa exclaims. “Well you’ll never be a real Filipino and never will have my flag or draw as good as me.” his classmate scoffs. “Uuuuhhhh ok, never asked for your flag and I’ll still be Filipino.” Koa kinda just stares blankly and walks into his classroom trying to figure out why exactly they said that. He encountered many racially charged experiences but none bothered him as much as that one. Not till years later will he just conclude, “Some people are just too proud and won’t accept others, that’s ok I’ll be proud regardless of what others think,” he smirks as he thinks to himself. \nKoa did in fact have a knack for drawing. Certainly not the best with characters or such. He did excel with cars and buildings, Koa was known for drawing Most of the time during elementary and middle school you’d find him in class or the library sketching away on grid paper. Why grid paper? Sometime in fifth grade, he was handed a scholastic magazine with blueprints on them. He always drew and was now introduced to architecture. What better than to mesh one hobby with an entirely new one?! So for the coming years, he spent drawing cities upon cities. Creating countless random modern homes on them. He taped them together to make one long picture. This project took up most of his time, and that didn’t bother him much. One thing about Koa during these times, he didn’t have many friends and wasn’t as social as he is now. He struggled, for the most part, to be who he truly was as he haven’t gotten to explore many pathways life had to offer.\nThat changed when he got his driver’s license. Yet another significant change in his life. A new door had been open for the young man, finally able to go out and explore as he always wanted. For most of his life, he would just stay home. A pretty mundane way of life. Go to school, go back home, do chores and that's it. No longer did he have to be anchored or restricted to be stuck at home. Even more so after high school, he got his very first car. The first opportunity to be ankle to socialize freely without having to rely on his mother to take him. Taking full advantage of his opportunity, he goes out with many childhood friends who were as easily accessible to associate with. He starts to be more active and in turn more social when he goes out. Constantly going to the park, playing soccer, able to stay out later. he gains the sense off freedom he never felt before. The young man keeps seeking more and finds a job that is enough to allow him to have time and money. But as time goes on, “How realistic is this way of life?” he poses this question to himself.]", "subject": "instructional_rewriting", "answer": "Here are some suggestions for improving how you showcase Koa in this essay:\n\n1. Provide more vivid descriptions and details about Koa's personality, interests, and values to help the reader get a stronger sense of who he is as an individual. The essay currently focuses more on the events of his life rather than painting a clear picture of his character.\n\n2. Use more quotes, anecdotes, or specific examples that reveal Koa's voice, thoughts, and way of viewing the world. This will make him feel like a more realized, multi-dimensional character.\n\n3. Consider restructuring the chronological narrative to highlight pivotal moments or turning points that shaped Koa's sense of identity and path in a more focused way.\n\n4. Develop the thematic threads you introduce (like his struggle to be his own person, feeling unmotivated/misdirected, depression at a young age) through tighter connections between the life events you describe and Koa's inner journey.\n\n5. Clarify Koa's current situation and mindset as a 22-year-old trying to find purpose and satisfaction. Is he actively pursuing new directions? Reflecting on his past? The present-day framing could be stronger.\n\n6. Use more vivid sensory details and descriptive language to immerse the reader in the key settings and time periods of Koa's life.\n\nThe goal would be to make Koa feel like a fully fleshed-out, compelling character that readers can vividly picture and empathize with on a deeper level throughout his experiences."}

{"question": "You are Anthropology Professor who assigned the essay to me. This is prompt\n\nIn Cannibal Capitalism, Nancy Fraser argues that we need an expanded understanding of capitalism beyond simply a focus on production in order to understand the range of crises affecting the world. In this paper, explain how Fraser extends Marx’s insights about capitalism to show how capitalism is producing crises but also how these crises afford us avenues for progressive social and political change.\n\nCould you improve my essay below to get A \n\n-----\nThe idea that the market is a panacea for our life’s problems is a central tenet of neoclassical economic thought. Neoclassical economics is a school of economic thought that emphasizes the value of free market competition and how individuals make decisions based on rational calculations of costs and benefits. It assumes that markets are self-regulating and efficient in allocating resources, and that individuals are rational agents who make decisions based on their own self-interest. The invisible hand of the market determines the price based on the supply and demand and maximizes social welfare. This argument has been used to justify the free market policies such as privatization of public services, industry deregulation and the reduction of government intervention in the economy. However, this belief is increasingly being challenged by scholars. While the market can be an effective mechanism for allocating certain resources and creating wealth, it is not a panacea for the social, racial, economic, and environmental challenges that we face today.\nKarl Marx, a renowned German philosopher, developed a unique perspective on capitalism, socialism, and communism. His understanding of capitalism differs significantly from neoclassical economists, which asserts that economic activity cannot be understood as a mere process of exchange, but is shaped by the social relations of production (Fraser, 2022, p20). He criticizes the idea of neoclassical economics for failing to address the underlying relations of exploitation and class conflict that are hardwired into capitalism, and for focusing solely on the exchange of goods and services in the market. In contrast, he views capitalism as a system of class domination centered on the exploitation of free labor by capital in commodity production (Fraser, 2022, p44). He analyzes the structure through which a small group of capitalists who own the means of production extract surplus value from the majority of people who have to sell their labor. This results in a system of inequality and exploitation, with capitalists profiting from the labor of workers.\nNancy Frazer, an American philosopher and feminist shares the view with Marx that capitalism is a system that organizes the relation of production and exchange to their non-economic conditions of possibility (Fraser, 2022, p85). Besides, she appreciates the lens of exploitation he introduces as it highlights the structural basis in capitalist society for the class domination of free workers (Fraser, 2022, p45). However, she criticizes and extends Marx’s view in her book Cannibal Capitalism as she believes that his view does not account for the realm of non-economic activity that is bound up with exploitation sufficiently. She contends that non-marketized aspects such as social reproduction, polity, and natural resources are indispensable to marketized aspects of capitalist societies and ignoring or treating them as if they are infinite and free leads to the cannibalization of our society (Fraser, 2022, p37). In capitalist society, there is a boundary between \"production\" from \"reproduction,\" \"economy\" from \"polity,\" and \"society\" from \"nature\" to distinguish between them. These resources necessary for economic activity are often viewed as having no monetary value and are taken for granted as if they are free and infinitely available. As they assume no responsibility for sustaining them, this leads to a crisis in social reproduction, race, and ecology. She claims that these crises worsen each other and pose a significant threat to our survival (Fraser, 2022, p16).\n Social reproduction involves not only the activity of reproducing new human beings , but also the maintenance of social bonds that underpins social cooperation (Fraser, 2022, p24). This includes tasks such as giving birth, performing household chores, and socializing the young. However, in capitalist societies, social reproduction is often detached from economic production, leading to care work and affective labor being undervalued unless they are commodified and turned into paid labor (Fraser, 2022, p25). Thus, she criticizes the Marxist view for not fully explaining that behind the process of production is unwaged care work, often performed by women, which replenishes the labor force.This presents a paradox, as the capitalist economy relies on social bonds, but does not accord them monetary value. This ultimately impairs the system’s ability to produce and maintain labor power (Fraser, 2022, p64, p85). \n\nAnother precondition for the functioning of capitalism is public powers, usually states, that supply legal and military might that enforce and establish constitutive norms (Fraser, 2022, p27). Public power encompasses various functions, such as enacting legal orders, maintaining repressive forces, and providing public goods that serve to guarantee property rights, enforce contracts, settle disputes, and sustain the money supply that is essential to the survival of capital (Fraser, 2022, p116). Legal systems establish what appears to be politically neutral spaces where private actors could pursue their “economic” interest without a form of “political” interference. Similarly, at the geopolitical level, transnational political arrangements such as international law and brokered agreements among the Great Powers enable people to expand their business across borders.Accumulation and market exchange are impossible without such a legal and military framework. \n\nLast thing that production depends on is nonhuman nature, which is both a key input including raw materials and sources of energy for capitalists and a dumpster for their rubbish (Fraser, 2022, p85). In their pursuit of profit maximization, capitalists seek to exploit nature as cheap as possible by disavowing the ecological costs generated by production. Their perspective is rooted in the myth that nature can replenish itself infinitely and autonomously.\nWorks Cited\nFraser, N. (2022).

{"question": "So there's this song we sing with a toddler when we're giving God thanks for our food:\n\n\"God is great and God is good\nAnd we thank Him for our food\nBy His hands we all are fed\n'Give us, Lord, our daily bread\nGive us, Lord, our daily bread'\nAmen\"\n\nBut this one time the toddler wanted us to sing it at bedtime. It didn't really make sense though since it was a song about giving thanks for food—not about going to bed—but we sang it anyway.\n\nNext time, though, we'd like to sing a different version that has to do with going to bed rather than eating food.\n\nCould you modify that song to keep the same style/feel but have it be about thankfulness for being able to go to bed/sleep rather than about having food to eat?", "subject": "instructional_rewriting", "answer": "\"God is great and God is good\nAnd we thank Him for our rest\nBy His hands we all are blessed\nHe gives us peace, He gives us rest\nGive us, Lord, a peaceful night\nGuide us through 'til morning light\nGuide us through 'til morning light\nAmen\""}
