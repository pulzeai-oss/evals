The earlier drop in the stock market from 50 bps priced in the possibility that the Fed was going to rise the rates even further while the 50 bps in December helped traders in Wall Street to priced in the probability that the Fed was going to slow down. Such realization not only fulfill my curiosity towards the effect of policy on financial market but also strengthen my determination to pursue an advanced degree.\nAcademically, I take a great number of professional courses ranging from social science courses, like Micro/Macroeconomics, Business economics to technical courses, such as Data analytics and Quantitative methods in Finance to create a holistic foundation of my skillset. Soon, I wanted to get involved in something more engaging and practical, as a result, I participated in various academic projects where I was able to apply theoretical models to a practical setting and understand the basic concept more profoundly. In the project of Solow Model of Economic Growth, I prototyped steady state of GDP-per-capita given different scenarios and provided economic justifications to the model output. Specifically, I utilized Solow Model to investigate the short-term and long-term effect on GDP-per-capita when other factors are changing, for example, increase in capital stock. Another project related to Consumption-savings Model promoted my economic intuition to the next level. When I applied Consumption-savings model with log utility to explain the relationships between consumption and savings decision, I provided reasonable explanations for the effect of interest rate increase on consumption and saving decision and offered economic intuition to the effect of different discount factor and the design of the model. Apart from my experience at UCSD, I also got involved in program at UBC. When performing thorough analysis on global economy characteristics and projecting its long-term growth and trend, I analyzed the relationships between international relations and public policy and how they affect global economy. \nMy experience is not limited to academics; Beyond school work, I always seized every opportunity that can possibly improve myself as a better candidate. My experience as a Media Operations Intern at Guangzhou Cultural Creativity Industry Association helped to shape my soft skills. When I worked collaboratively with internal team to design and implement various activities, I collected and shared results and feedback from promotional events with supervisor for improved decision-making. Moreover, I was also responsible for maintaining corporate relationship with business partners and leveraging social media platforms to support business’ long-term growth. This internship helped me realized the importance of the collaboration across various teams and also improved my communication and leaderships skills. Later, I worked as an asset management intern at GF Securities where my technical skills were honed. In addition to playing a key role in the IPO process and applying my economic knowledge, I also programed an automatic data process pipeline that covered data collection, cleaning and standardization process for companies’ fundamental data. Because the data from the data vendor was not perfect as my team wished, I designed missing value imputation method with specifical imputing rules to ensure the quality of the data. On the modeling side, I also served as a good quantitative modeler; I researched the fundamentals behind various discounted cash flow models to facilitate arbitrage strategy research and conduced in-depth analysis on the educations field and forecasted cash flows based on technical indicators.

Thank you. \n\n2.3.1 Previous Studies on L2 Motivational Self-System\nAs an important factor affecting learning effectiveness, learners' motivation has received the attention of many researchers, who have explored the nature of motivation from various research perspectives （Wang Xiaomin & Zhang Wenzhong, 2005). Foreign language motivation has gone through four major developmental stages: 1. the psychosocial period (1959-1990); 2. the cognitive context period (1990s); 3. the process-oriented period (2000-2005); and 4. the social dynamic period (now) (Jin Haiyun, 2013). Dörnyei's L2MSS theory is the latest achievement in this period. Research at home and abroad on L2 motivational self-system can be divided into confirmatory studies of L2 motivational self-system and correlation studies of L2 motivational self-system with other variables.\n2.3.1.1 Confirmatory studies of L2 motivational self-system at home and abroad\nThe L2MSS has got strong reactions in the academic circles since its introduction. Dörnyei and Csizer et al. (2006) conducted a large-scale empirical study in Hungary with more than 13,000 students and concluded that the ideal L2 self and the ought-to L2 self play an important role in language learning. Since this famous study, researchers have conducted a great number of empirical studies in different countries such as Hungary (Csizer & Kormos, 2009), Japan (Ryan, 2009), Iran, and China (Taguchi, Magid & Papi, 2009) to verify the validity and operationalization of L2MSS.\nCsizer and Kormos (2009) took a questionnaire to investigate the similarities and differences in the motivation of Hungarian learners at different levels, and also compared the relationship between the ideal L2 self and the ought-to L2 self of the L2MSS and traditional motivation. The study verified the validity of L2MSS in the Hungarian context, and they found that the ideal L2 self, the ought-to L2 self, and the L2 learning experience are independent motivational factors. Ryan (2009) conducted an empirical study of 2397 college and high school English learners from a variety of schools and found that the ideal L2 self was very highly correlated with traditional integrative motivation, but Dörnyei's ideal L2 self was more effective than Gardner's integrative motivation in explaining motivated behavior of learners. Taguchi, Magid, and Papi (2009) carried out a large empirical study of nearly 5,000 students from three Asian countries (China, Japan, and Iran), including middle school students, college students majoring in English and non-English, and adult language learners. Through correlation analysis and structural equation modeling, this study also confirmed the validity of the three components of L2MSS and validated the theory in these three Asian countries. In China, Liu, Fengge (2012) found that the ideal L2 self is more relevant to second language motivation than the traditional integrative motivation for Chinese English learners, which is similar with the conclusion of Dörnyei and Ryan.\nAnd then she carried out a study to test the validity of the L2MSS in a Chinese language learning context with 956 English learners of five different English levels (Elementary and middle school students, English major undergraduates, non-English major undergraduates, English major postgraduates, non-English major postgraduates) (2015). The results showed that the L2MSS is applicable to investigate the motivation of all kinds of Chinese learners who learn English as a foreign language, and the ideal L2 self is more powerful than the integrative motivation in explaining learners motivation. Since then, there has been a growing body of research on L2MSS in China.\nThese studies validated Dörnyei's \"L2MSS\" and showed that the theory can be used in different language learning contexts, which also provided insight for the implementation of this study.", "subject": "language_polishing", "answer": "Here's your draft with some minor changes to improve readability:\n\n2.3.1 Previous Studies on L2 Motivational Self-System\n Learner motivation has been a widely studied factor influencing learning effectiveness, progressing through four stages: the psychosocial period, the cognitive context period, the process-oriented period, and the current social dynamic period, with Dörnyei's L2 Motivational Self-System (L2MSS) theory being the latest contribution.

Meanwhile, *Ryan (2009) conducted a large-scale study of 2,397 English learners from various schools, revealing a strong correlation between the ideal L2 self and traditional integrative motivation.* Additionally, Taguchi, Magid, and Papi (2009) conducted a comprehensive empirical study involving nearly 5,000 students from three Asian nations (China, Japan, and Iran), encompassing middle school students, college English majors and non-majors, and adult language learners. Their findings, obtained through correlation analysis and structural equation modeling, further confirmed the validity of the L2MSS's three components across these diverse Asian contexts.\n\nIn China, Liu and Fengge (2012) found that the ideal L2 self is a more accurate motivator for Chinese English learners than traditional integrative motivation. *Liu's subsequent study (2015) examined the validity of L2MSS among 956 English learners with varying proficiency levels in China and concluded that the model effectively motivates learners at all levels, surpassing integrative motivation.* These studies have validated the applicability of Dörnyei's L2MSS across different language learning contexts, providing a solid foundation for the present study.\n\nI hope this helps!

DeepRank-Core is designed to be an easily customizable deep learning pipeline that offers the ability to use two of the most powerful deep learning architectures available, depending on the problem-specific interaction patterns that the user intends to model. We demonstrate DeepRank-Core’s performance in an application of personalized cancer vaccines by modeling peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes and predicting their Binding Affinities (BAs), the understanding of which plays a key role in determining which patient’s mutated tumor peptides are best suited as vaccine candidates.

Roran was curled up on the floor with a blanket and pillow as his mother read him fairytales. Her voice was soft and warm, like the fire, and it wrapped around Roran like a hug. He loved evenings like this. He loved listening to his mother tell stories and the scratching of his father’s quill. He often joined them for stories and the three spent most of their evenings in this room before Roran was sent to bed.\nRoran was the only child of King Daris and Queen Jaelin. He knew they wished to give him siblings, but for reasons he didn’t understand, they wouldn’t. So they showered him in as much love as they had to give. And he was happy. Even at the young age of four years old, he knew how much they loved him and he loved them. Even though they were King and Queen, they spent as much time as they could with him, including times like this.\nBut this evening took a surprising turn. The door to the library burst open and Mage Kevala was standing in the doorway, a shocked look on her face.\n“Your Majesties!”\n“Kevala? What is the meaning of disrupting us at this hour?” King Daris stood from the small desk where he had been writing, his voice angry.\nRoran sat up. Kevala looked like she was about to cry and it struck Roran as odd. She had always been so strict and controlled. It was weird to see her emotions so open. Roran, suddenly scared, ran over to his mother and she drew him up into her lap, comforting him with a hug.\n“It’s Greschel.”\nThe King’s anger disappeared, “Greschel? What’s going on?”\nKevala looked back and forth between the King and Queen and she revealed a folded parchment. Roran pulled away a little from his mother’s embrace, his curiosity winning out over his fear. The King took the parchment, and even in the dim light of the fire, Roran could see the colour drain from his face.\n“Greschel is… dead!”\n“What?” The Queen’s arms loosened around Roran and her mouth had dropped open.\nRoran’s father turned around, his face blank with grief, “He had decided to travel north alone, before his company was ready to travel with him. He got sick and died before the healer could get there. I don’t understand. How could this happen?”\nThe room went quiet. Greschel had been the High Mage of Ascai and advisor to their majesties. Roran didn’t really know Greschel. The few times he had met the man, it had been brief, rather scary encounters. Greschel was tall and wore a scowl like his father wore a smile; all the time. Roran hadn’t liked him too much and always felt that Greschel had been watching him, disappointment and displeasure surrounding him like a cloud.\nBut Roran knew that his parents had liked him and their grief filled the room.\nRoran looked at Kevala. She looked back at him, fear in her eyes. As the King walked back over to the Queen, Kevala raised a hand like she was going to say something, but seemed to decide not to and stayed quiet. Her eyes lingered on Roran and he shifted uncomfortably in his mother’s lap, her frightened gaze igniting a new fear in Roran, though he couldn’t understand why. He turned back to his mother, who now had silent tears running down her face. He leaned into her and let her wrap her arms around him as she cried.\n\n####\n\nFeedback in CSV format:", "subject": "language_polishing", "answer": "Category,Impact,Text\nPraise,High,The opening scene is captivating and effectively sets the scene with a sense of warmth and intimacy, establishing Roran's loving family life.

{"question": "Points for improvements:\nUsing agricultural technologies, Rosegrant, M. W., et al. (2016) was able to come up with the conclusion that food production in the Philippines will decrease by 4% by 2050. One of the factors that cause the decline of food production is that climate change disturbs the weather pattern of the local area which makes farmers have a hard time selecting the best time to plant and harvest the crops. Tol, R. S. J. (2018), explained that in the short and medium term, climate change may seem to be beneficial for countries that depend on rain-fed agriculture. In the long-term and for the sustainability of the Earth, climate change only brings negative effects which will have a substantial impact on countries experiencing poverty. Carbon tax was developed to combat poverty vulnerability, though this might lead to a decrease in economic growth. Due to this reason, the implementation of a carbon tax should be carefully considered. Therefore, climate-resilient agriculture should be prioritized for stable food production in the Philippines. Climate change affects all aspects of nations. Although agriculture experiences the most drastic of effects, research and development towards this topic should be on high alert.", "subject": "language_polishing", "answer": "Some points for improvement in the given passage include:\n\n1.

{"question": "Help me write a blog post for the Christian AI Institute. Please revise this draft:\n\nWhat is an AI?\n\nAt the foundation of modern AIs like ChatGPT are Artifical Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs differ substantially from traditional, everyday types of computer programs and applications we are used to dealing with.\n\nANN Primer\nFundamentally, you interact with an ANN by providing an input (for example, some text, an image, some numbers, etc.) which the ANN transforms into an output (an image, some text, a classification, etc.).This transformation is accomplished through a network of neurons.\n\nA neuron is a simple mathemtical unit: it receives a number of inputs, multiplies each input by a weight (a number), then adds up these weighted inputs. The neuron then outputs a 0 if the sum is less than 0, or a 1 if the sum is greater than 1. The output of each neuron is then connected to many other neurons. That's it! There is nothing else inside of an ANN. There is no code. No text. No images. No datasets. Just functionally identical neurons with unique weights.\nTraining an AI\nWhen an ANN is newly created, the weights of each neuron are random, and the ANN is incapable of doing anything useful. In order to get it to do useful things the network is trained, much like how we teach children. Consider training a network to learn addition: first, you given the ANN a problem, such as \"2+2\". Then we see what the ANN outputs. If it outputs \"5,\" then we penalize the ANN, causing a change in the weights of the neurons. If it outputs \"4,\" then we reward the network, farther solidfying the weights of the neurons. This process is repeated millions or billions of times for a wide range of training data, until the ANN is able to produce correct outputs for every input we give it.\nTraditional Programs vs ANNs\nTraditional computer programs are written by programmers, who type out thousands of lines of computer code. Each line of code is specifically and intentionally written by a programmer. Every function and operation of the program is a direct consequence of how it is programmed. After the program is written, it is complete, and does not change.\nANNs, on the other hand, are not really programmed at all: instead, they are trained using examples.\nRamifications\nGiven the above, here are some notable ramifications:\n\n-If a computer program is not working properly, you can find the line of code responsible and change it.\n-If an ANN is not working as desired, there is no code within it that you can modify to change it!\n\n-You can alter a computer program by simply writing more code for it.\n-The only meaningful way to alter an ANN is to train it with more or different data.\n\n-You can determine how a computer program works by analyzing the human-readable code that it is made of.\n-The inner workings of an ANN, aka the weights of the neurons, are essentialy uninterpretable. For example, you could not inspect the inside of ChatGPT and find which neurons are responsible for the word, \"glove,\" or \"ball,\" or \"taste.\" (It is theoretical possible to interpret the inside of an ANN, but impossible in actuality due to computation limits.)\n\n-You can thoroughly test a computer program by testing the individual parts of it and inferring what it will output for untested intputs.\n-You cannot test individual parts of an ANN nor can you reliably infer the output of an ANN for an untested input. The ANN is not following any code or procedure that was written which we could analyze and its inner workings are not comprehensible.\n\nConclusion\nHopefully you see how different AI are from other computer programs. Indeed, these systems share much in common with human brains, which leads to many interesting and important questions. At the Christian AI Institute, we believe that the Bible holds the answers to many of these questions.", "subject": "language_polishing", "answer": "Understanding the intricacies of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial in today's technological landscape. At the Christian AI Institute, we delve into the depths of AI technology to uncover its true essence and explore how it aligns with our faith.\n\nAt the core of modern AIs like ChatGPT are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which operate in a vastly different manner than traditional computer programs. ANNs function through a network of neurons that receive inputs, process them through mathematical algorithms, and produce outputs. These neurons, with their unique weights, are the building blocks of AI systems.\n\nThe process of training an ANN mirrors the way we teach children - through repetitive learning and reinforcement. By providing the network with data and adjusting the weights of the neurons based on the accuracy of its outputs, we can train the AI to perform specific tasks effectively.\n\nIn contrast to traditional computer programs, which are meticulously coded by programmers, ANNs are not programmed in the conventional sense. Instead, they learn through examples and training data. This fundamental difference leads to various implications, such as the inability to modify an ANN by directly changing its code or interpreting its inner workings.\n\nThe Christian AI Institute recognizes the profound impact of AI technology on society and seeks to explore the intersection of AI and faith. By examining the parallels between AI systems and human brains, we aim to uncover deeper insights into the nature of intelligence and consciousness, guided by the wisdom found in the Bible.\n\nIn conclusion, AI systems like ANNs present a unique paradigm in the realm of technology, offering both challenges and opportunities for exploration. At the Christian AI Institute, we embrace this complexity and strive to navigate the ethical, philosophical, and spiritual dimensions of AI with a foundation rooted in Christian values. Join us on this transformative journey as we seek to understand the mysteries of AI through the lens of faith."}

Researchers in Machine Learning and interested people always knew that ML will be able to create things we could only imagine, but normal people seeing and interacting with it is a whole other ballgame. So I believe that it will push the adoption of Machine Learning across all industries much further along.", "subject": "language_polishing", "answer": "Machine Learning has experienced tremendous growth and advancements in recent years, and I believe that ChatGPT represents a pivotal moment akin to the 1969 Moon Landing.
