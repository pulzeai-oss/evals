{"question": "summarize this:\n\nSilicon Valley Bank Collapse - Allāh Destroys Ribā\nIt happened on Friday, the 16th largest bank in the United States collapsed due to a bank run. This shows the fragility of the system.\nNews agencies can try to explain the reasons as being poor risk management and losses on securities, they can blame the Federal Reserve, even here in Canada, regulators seized the assets of the Toronto branch.\nIs this something new? Not at all. We can talk about the virtual economy that is created by Ribā and the stock market. Numbers are overinflated and the wishful thinking of investors are culprits as well. All it takes is a slight loss in confidence. Depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money, and stockholders also rush to sell their valueless stocks.\nWe should not get entrapped in the symptoms, brothers and sisters. What we are seeing today, what we saw in the 2008 financial crisis and others before it, are symptoms of the inherent problem.\nThe trouble started when money no longer carried any intrinsic value. Never in the history of man have we been in a situation in which money is literally created out of thin air by a cartel of private bankers. The Federal Reserve in the United States is not federal and it certainly has no reserves.\nBefore President Nixon's decision on August 15, 1971 to completely eliminate gold from the money equation, there was the gold exchange standard where money was tied to gold.\nBefore the gold exchange standard was the gold standard, and this was before the United States government, under President Franklin D Roosevelt, seized all gold from its citizens on March 9, 1933.\nConventional banking, which has its own history and development, is fueled by the modern fiat monetary system.\nBanks don't have money stored away. Money is created when banks give out loans. Money is created from debt!\nSo such collapses are not a surprise nor should they be.\nGold never gets old. If you have savings, invest them in gold coins outside of the grid. I mean go out and buy gold coins and store them away yourself.\nThe United States is bankrupt, and things will only get worse as time passes.\nIt is a blessing that I am in the process of writing my book on Ribā and Islamic banking. People in general, and Muslims in particular, have to have some foundational knowledge of how we came to the situation we are in today as far as the monetary system.\nWe have to know what is Sharī‘ah compliant and adhere to it.\nThose convenient Fatāwā about it being permissible to buy a house on a conventional mortgage in the West are not only fragile as far as their justifications and proofs, but as time continues, practical events will prove that there is nothing good about Ribā.\nA house bought with Ribā is a cursed house.", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank due to a bank run highlights the fragility of the financial system. The root of the issue lies in the creation of money out of thin air by private bankers, leading to inflated numbers and a lack of intrinsic value in currency. The history of the monetary system, from the gold standard to the fiat system, is discussed, with a call to invest in gold as a stable alternative. The importance of understanding and adhering to Islamic banking principles is emphasized, as conventional banking practices involving ribā (interest) are seen as problematic and detrimental in the long run."}

artificial intelligence will take our jobs much of this is hype but some of it gets it very real questions about ai's impact on our future the question is how can you be prepared and best adapt to the intelligently automated future i'm paul ratzer founder and ceo of marketing artificial intelligence institute in this video you'll learn what jobs will be taken over by ai in the future and what skills will remain essential in an ai first world i've done hundreds of talks on artificial intelligence and almost every time someone asks me right off the bat am i going to lose my job ai will replace humans in some jobs but it will also create new opportunities to understand what machines will excel at and what will remain uniquely human we have to start with what are machines very good at doing machines excel at things that are very hard for humans like intelligently automating repetitive tasks so doing things over and over and over again except the machine never gets tired it never forgets and it can just keep going the other is managing large data sets finding anomalies in the data sets making predictions based on that data the machine doesn't get tired of looking at data and analyzing it and so those are things that humans aren't very good at on the opposite end things that come easy for humans are very hard for machines walking it's very difficult to teach a machine how to walk object recognition like if a toddler looks at two objects and you say this is a cat and this is a dog the toddler is going to remember the difference machines don't work that way so that's a starting point to think about the things that remain uniquely human is to understand the things that machines are going to have a very hard time learning and excelling at the thing i always tell people is if you do a very specific repetitive task and that is all you do every day such as a b testing landing pages or figuring out media spend for digital advertising those things will go away those tasks machines are better at right now so if your job is a very specific repeatable task you should be looking for a new one right now and leveling up your skill sets so there will be some jobs but for the most part what's going to disappear are specific roles or tasks within jobs you're going to make a list of all these things you do every day and you're gonna find the things that you can intelligently automate because they're repetitive the other reality is anytime there's a major technological innovation or transformation in any industry new jobs are created that we can't imagine yet and that's the exciting thing to me is i think we're going to see a whole new realm of opportunities emerge for people to define totally new career paths applying ai to marketing in order to imagine what these future roles may look like we need to think about the skills and traits that remain uniquely human for example empathy a machine does not have feelings it doesn't understand human feelings there's lots of things you can do with emotion nai it can be trained to see sad faces it can use things called facial recognition to actually know that you're frowning or that you're crying and it can be told that that means that human is sad so if it knows that a human is sad it can actually evolve its prediction of messaging it might evolve the ads that are running to that person it might evolve the the images within ads but the machine itself doesn't feel emotion or truly understand human emotion so empathy is almost impossible to give to a machine and when you think about as a marketer how important that is to our job to understand consumers to understand pain points to understand fears they have we can't teach the machine those things and so empathy is a critical trait moving forward strategy is another uniquely human ability a machine doesn't know what to predict and it doesn't know what to do with the prediction unless it's told by a human there's a great book called prediction machines that says the future of all work in every industry is telling the machine what to predict and knowing what to do with the prediction and so when we think about marketing and how strategy applies the machine will be there to help solve problems it will be there to intelligently automate things but it needs to be told what to do what problems to solve and that's going to be where marketers come in is being able to look at problems in their business and say i know that ai can help me solve this better creativity i would argue remains uniquely human there are some ai experts who would say that ai has demonstrated creativity in solving problems but in my opinion it's math the the machine isn't taking life experiences and it's not using emotion to come up with new ideas it's not creative in the way that we are creative as humans when you think about music or artwork or writing so much of what we've gone through in our lives is what enables the output so much more goes into the creative process and so i would just say that to me creativity as we know it and have come to define it is not possible in machines curiosity is another that i consider uniquely human as humans so much of what we seek to discover and to learn comes from that curiosity within us to be better to go to new places the machine doesn't go looking for problems to solve it doesn't have intrinsic motivation to get better and so curiosity to me and all the things that become possible as a result of it remain uniquely human intuition is critical to the role of every marketer so much of what we decide to do is based on instinct machines don't have instinct they have probabilities of an outcome happening the real opportunity the real magic though comes when you combine those two things when the machine makes predictions based on probabilities and the human uses intuition to figure out if those predictions make sense once we understand the things that remain uniquely human and the things that the machine excels at ai actually has the potential to make us more human as individuals and as brands once the machines do what they do intelligently automating tasks it's going to drive efficiency within businesses it's going to free up human resources to do uniquely human things so you can look at it and say great we can cut costs we can reduce staff but what if you looked at it the other way and said well what good can we do with this time can we listen to our customers better can we be more socially responsible can we find better ways to get involved in the community and so there's this part of me that believes that ai is actually the opportunity to while intelligently automating tasks open up the possibility to become more human to become better people to do more good for our customers for our prospects for our employees and for society ai isn't making humans obsolete anytime soon but the landscape and the industry have changed in order to deliver the level of personalization and convenience that modern consumers expect brands must embrace ai and marketing must become marketer plus machine\"\nShare Prompt", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "The

{"question": "Title: \"(20) The Summit - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"this is for you if you ever feel like you should be further ahead in life than what you are in right now and there are areas which are lagging no matter what you try and do you just can't seem to fix it this could be in terms of your energy this could be in terms of anxiety this could be in terms of your career you're not making the steps that you thought you would you're not making the money that you thought you would you're not being the dad the partner the husband that you wanted to be if you're just not showing up as the man that you you thought you would be by now this is going to be really really helpful for you you've probably tried everything under the sun in order to fix it but every time you do something every time you make even an inch of progress something just drags you back down and so you work your ass off again to try and get back up to where you want to be it could be financially it could be with your relationships it could be the way that you look and you make a bit of progress and then something drags you back down again and no matter what happens you just can't seem to get everything that you want if that sounds familiar keep listening because I got something for you which is really really simple and is going to really really uh easily help you fix it so okay so I'll switch over to the iPad right now this is a very very incredibly lifelike drawing of a Summoner Mountain down here is you once again very like flag here is base camp and then up the top is the summit okay oops I just erased that up the top is the summit okay I'm just going to briefly outline these Concepts where you are right now you're on what we call the hamster wheel right where you're constantly working your ass off but it feels like you're not really getting anywhere or you're not getting anywhere as fast as what you should be it feels inefficient and it feels like you have a high level of friction right things are just more difficult than what they should be base camp is where you're at Square zero you're at Ground Zero you're just about to start your climb everything's totally neutral and the Summit is where you want to be this is where you're the ultimate Dad this is where you're the ultimate partner or husband this is where you're making the money you're living your dream life this is where everything is great your Health's incredible your relationships are incredible and your wealth is also so incredible right everything is absolutely on song and that's obviously where you want to be and one of the things that we see that prevents a lot of dudes from actually getting to the summit Step One is they don't know what Summit they're actually climbing what is it that they're working towards a lot of guys get confused because there are so many different Summers that we can climb I mean let's think about it you a lot of guys go out and they chase money they chose huge amounts of money they just want to build a massive amount of wealth a lot of other guys want to chase lifestyle some guys Trace Chase drugs some guys chase women some guys Chase there's so many different things that we can chase but what is absolutely certain is that if you climb up an alternate Summit because remember there are millions of these Summits you've got money up here you've got you know drugs over here you've got women over on another one you've got whatever we've got all these different goals that we can chase all these different Summers that we can chase but if they're not in an alignment with what we actually want when we reach them we're going to be totally unfilled and that's where we climb up one mountain we come back down we climb up another we come back down and we never feel like we're actually getting anywhere so the very first thing that we need to do is we need to get clear on well what is my Summit what do I actually want from this life when I'm old and gray and smelly and my Skin's all falling out and I've got tubes up my ass down my throat up my up my nose there's a machine helping my lungs to pump what do I want to look back on on my life how do I want to have envisioned my life so that's the first thing we need to get really really clear on what do we want our Summit to be then the next thing after that that we need to do is we need to get out of the hamster wheel right we need to get off this world because whenever we're stuck here on the hamster wheel we're just going around and around and around and around in circles and we'll never actually make it up the mountain it'll never happen so the first step is that we need to get from here on the hamster wheel onto base camp and what base camp looks like is this you've got no friction there's nothing holding you back those anchors those things which are just dragging you down all the time you don't have them you have incredible energy you have no anxiety you're managing your stress really well you'll never evade stress completely in life but you'll know how to deal with it you're on point physically mentally and you're clear on the direction that you need to go that is what we call base camp and once you get to base camp that's where you can actually start the ascent at the summit see one of the other big reasons why so many guys never actually make it up this Summit is because they're trying to climb on the biggest climb of their life stressed out anxious with low testosterone terrible energy they just feel awful can you imagine climbing Mount Everest and feeling like that it's never going to happen and see the thing climbing to your goal and climbing to your whole life's purpose which is essentially what your summit is it's the biggest climate you'll ever do in your life and it's permanent if you're trying to do that bad boy with no energy stressed out anxious low testosterone feeling awful you're never going to make it and so what we need to do is we need to get you to base camp first where you're feeling really good and then we can begin the climb and so the next thing once we've got you here at base camp what do you need when you're at base camp you need this you need a map if you don't have a map you're never going to make it up the mountain I don't know if you guys have ever done any mountain climb but I've done a fair bit and so it always helps to learn how to actually get up to the top because if you wing it on the way it's really really slow the next thing that you always need is you need a guide you need a sherpa as such Edmund Hillary Sir Edmund Hillary the man the first man to Summit Mount Everest or the first white man I think that was able to Summit Mount Everest he failed twice before he only got it on the third time do you know the difference between the first two times and the third it's the third time you had some sherpets he had a sherbet tensing Norge was his name right who actually helped him guide guide him all the way up the mountain and so what we need if we're going to get from base camp all the way up to the summit is we need to have a map a plan and we need to have a guide on how you're going to get there when you have those two things that is when you'll be able to get to the summit okay and so this is really really incredibly important so what I want you to take away from from this video is this first of all if you want to get to where you want to be if you want to be able to actually make more money if you want to be able to be a better dad you want to be a better partner you want to be happier you want to be healthy you want to feel better well first of all you need to know what the Summit is you need to know where your summit is you need to know what game you're playing not somebody else's game not society's game not someone says hey you should be a doctor you should be making this amount of money this is how you should be as a dad you need to have exactly three kids what game are you playing so it's the first thing Clarity the second thing after that is we need to get you off the hamster wheel and get you up to base camp because when you're at base camp that's when you can actually get up to the top and the third thing is you need a map and you need a guide and that is how you get there you're not just going to wing it on the way up because as there are going to be obstacles as we all know you need to make sure that you have a plan on how you're going to get to your summit and you need to have someone there who's going to hold you accountable and guide you the whole way okay on that note guys I'll leave you all to it if you have any questions as always feel free to reach out I hope this helps\"\nVideo Summary:", "subject":

{"question": "Please summarise the following article in 4 dot points of the critical points\n\nMany animals are known to engage in play—usually large-brained mammals (like humans) and birds. Now scientists think they have observed genuine play behavior in bees, which were filmed rolling small colored wooden balls, according to an October paper published in the journal Animal Behavior.\n\n“This research provides a strong indication that insect minds are far more sophisticated than we might imagine,\" said co-author Lars Chittka of Queen Mary University of London and author of a recent book, The Mind of a Bee. \"There are lots of animals who play just for the purposes of enjoyment, but most examples come from young mammals and birds.\"\n\nPlay behavior is typically divided into three broad categories, per the authors. Social play involves playful interactions between animals, usually juveniles engaged in play-fighting. For instance, there is anecdotal evidence from prior studies (one dating back to 1820) for social play among ants and young wasps. Locomotor play involves running, jumping, or similar intense and sustained movement that is not associated with a particular purpose. And object play involves manipulation of an object as a toy.\n\nChittka's group conducted a previous study in 2017 in which they showed that bees could be trained to roll little wooden balls in order to receive a reward. But they also noticed instances where the bees opted to roll the balls even when there wasn't an obvious reward or benefit. The balls had been placed in a tunnel that connected the hive to the experimental arena where the food was. Several bees walked over the balls or stopped to roll them on their way back and forth from the food. Chittka et al. wondered if this might be genuine play behavior, and decided to investigate further.\n\nIt's not easy to design an experiment to conclusively demonstrate that bees (or other insects or animals) are engaged in play behavior specifically. It's not like you can just ask the bees if they're having fun. Five basic criteria must be met.\n\nFirst, the behavior should not be performed in order to get food, attract a mate, or find shelter. Second, the play behavior should be \"voluntary, spontaneous and rewarding in and of itself,\" instead of being associated with a reward of some kind. Third, the motor actions for the play behavior should be different from the actions performed when searching for food or trying to mate. Fourth, the play behavior is repeated but not stereotyped, in order to differentiate between a one-off occurrence vs. an habitual tic. Finally, the play should be initiated when the subject is relaxed, to distinguish it from stress-related behaviors like pacing or walking, both which are often observed in caged zoo animals.\n\nFor these new experiments, Chittka et al. followed a similar setup. They placed 45 bees in the arena and let them choose to walk along a straight line to a foraging area with food, or wander off that path through an area with colored wooden balls. Even when they were done feeding, most bees (37) chose to roll balls for at least one extra day after, with 29 rolling balls for two extra days after feeding. Individual bees rolled balls between 1 and 117 times across the duration of the experiment, with the latter number suggesting at least some of the bees found the activity rewarding.\n\nIn a second experiment to help determine whether this qualified as play, another 42 bees were provided access to two color-coded chambers, one of which was empty while the other always contained wooden balls. Then the balls were removed and the bees were given a choice of which chamber to spend time in. They showed a strong preference for the chamber with a color that was previously associated with the wooden balls. A third experiment revealed that younger bees rolled balls more frequently than older bees, and male bees rolled balls for longer duration than female bees.\n\nAll in all, the authors argue that the behavior of the bees in their experiments met the five basic criteria for play. “It is certainly mind-blowing, at times amusing, to watch bumble bees show something like play,\" said co-author Samadi Galpayage, a graduate student in Chittka's lab. \"They approach and manipulate these ‘toys’ again and again. It goes to show, once more, that despite their little size and tiny brains, they are more than small robotic beings. They may actually experience some kind of positive emotional states, even if rudimentary, like other larger fluffy, or not so fluffy, animals do.”", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "- Study suggests bees exhibit genuine play behavior by rolling colored wooden balls\n- Play behavior in animals typically categorized into social, locomotor, and object play\n- Experiment conducted to show bees engaged in play behavior as per five basic criteria\n- Bees showed preference for rolling balls even when not associated with a reward, suggesting possible enjoyment and positive emotional states"}

This will be a forcing function) \n · Interconnection as % of revenue growing from X to Y (same principle as above)\n \n4. Charles\n \n5. Jon\n · Digital services is generating revenues outside of colo-related interconnection (exclude Fabric, IX, EC, MC) of > 500M.\n · Digital services is growing attach-rate/adoption by existing or new customers to 100+ G2000 enterprises, or 1000+ paying customers (over $1k MRR)\n · Our partner ecosystem is driving new incremental, low/no-touch acquisitions of > 20% of the partner deal mix.\n · Our company valuation shows multiple expansion based on the growth/revenue opportunity of digital services being valued as high-growth cloud-like valuations additive to the core.\n \n6. Justin\n · Digital services revenue from PLG/developer-led sales motion surpasses that of sales-led.\n · X% (e.g. >50%) attach rate across digital services (more than half of DS customers use at least 2 digital services)\n · Y% (e.g. > 25%) attach rate between data center services and digital services\n · Lower marginal cost of development for each new service\n · From product-centric to “experience-centric” development model (from linear product curation & value creation to exponential multi-sided value creation)… Platforms can enable an “inverted” business model, where the value could be derived primarily from a community (e.g. developers and technology partners) driving down the marginal cost of new products or services to virtually zero.\n · Developers love, praise and promote Platform Equinix (see diagrams for reference)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n7.

Keith\n · I think it will be a multi-faceted view on success and outcomes. Yes, revenue growth will be important, but I think more important will be % of customers adopting digital services, number of services by deployment or customer, unit and total profitability as expressed in dollars with benefit to AFFO and AFFO per share, and rate of acceleration. Cash flow will create company valuation appreciation. Also, I think scale of infrastructure – number of countries, markets and buildings – will make a huge difference too. Speed of deployment will also be a tell-tale sign of success, which will determine the slope of the curve. \n \n9. Kurt\n · Point of lack of clarify, even in the example it defines the platform mostly in reference to digital. I think our platform is a platform as we have a full continuum that supports metal, to hybrid, to full colo. There is dissonance in the statements above. Platform is not digital alone.\n 1. When we have an MVP that supports customers in gaining access to the full suite of Equinix services through one or more methods of interaction (i.e. self service to full service) and multiple methods of purchase (direct or indirect). [Note, I didn’t say fully integrated billing, fully integrated portals, etc. But, we do need to have thoughtful ways to delivery a consistent look, feel and customer journey for the set of customers we want).\n \n 2. We have a fully developed self service capability for digital products across the full spectrum of digital products.\n 3. We have solved the issue of traditional colo products being sold digitally. What I mean by this is for colo customers who buy fabric, we need to make this easy within the environment they live in. Reality is, we need our colo customers to buy a lot of digital for digital to grow at the pace we want. Some of them may never by metal, but we certainly need it super easy to buy fabric and requiring them to move to a completely different system to buy the connectivity defeats the purpose. If they have to contract for fabric separately, why wouldn’t they just buy the same service from a telecom they already have a contract with?\n \n 4. Have defined our target customer\n \n10. Mike\n · Digital Services is generating X revenues per year. (I am fine with it being inclusive of Fabric)\n · We have co-built at least three products in the market with leading companies.\n · Customers can procure our digital services in a self-service model with a pay for usage billing model.\n · We have created a sustainable support model for digital services.\n \n11. Milind\n\n12. Nicole \n · People/Workforce/Brand:\n · The workforce can clearly articulate the company vision. \n · Brand identity is shifting in the market from data center company (space and power) to platform company. Metrics around reach, impressions, community engagement, style of customers hitting the platform, etc.. \n \n · Growth and Bookings:\n · Strategic value of the platform seen through net new customer growth of X percent, current customer growth across digital services of X percent (think measuring cross sell up sell) . \n · Scale and growth being driven through key synergies with critical ecosystem partners. Think Dell, HPE, and VMW (as examples). We would have have clear goals/targets between the companies for growth, and have successful product partnerships/ co-branding. IE: Dell drives “X” number of customers and or revenue to the Equinix platform. \n · Digital services hits $2B in revenue in 2 years (by end of 2025) and is growing at software market pace. Users would be consuming at rate exponentially higher than current state. \n · Sustainability efforts are clearly defined and part of overall strategic mission. (thus, not slowing down sales and ability to pursue deals that require sustainability gates). Should we consider this as a potential service revenue stream in future state? I know there will be specific sustainability targets and expectations by region so we should build it in now to our metrics/strategic approach. \n · Systems and Tools: \n · We have successfully implemented key shifts in our own internal digital transformation to provide a delightful experience for customers. For example, \n 1) Automation is in place to enable the “pull” of the platform in instead of the “push” it is today. Measure through metrics like employee productivity metrics, percentage of AI enabled tools, return on digital investments, Revenue/bookings from digital technology, ROI on digital/architecture investments. \n 2) Our architecture is designed for software style services and a simplified/seamless user experience. Similar metrics above could measure progress here I would think. \n · We have unified interfaces and solutions instead of puzzle pieces we are trying to stitch together. We’ve built a delightful experience for supporting our customers that want to buy multiple services together. This could be reflected through our NPS scores perhaps? \n \n13. PVC\n · I believe all 6 of the above matter. Tougher to assign numbers or an expectation of 4 thru 6 in an outcome as yet, but some form of measured progress will need to happen\n \n14.

Scott\n · I do not understand the premise or intent of the Phase 1 questions. I don't think a platform vision is \"proven\" at the time it is ready to scale (it is only proven in retrospect, years later). You have to make it scale, and while you’re doing so, you encounter blockers every year or 18 months which you must overcome if you wish to continue scaling. If you fail to overcome those blockers (and evolve the platform based on market experience and evolution), it stops scaling. It is a continuum, not a point in time. So I'm not sure what we're asking here. Are we asking the thresholds we need to meet at various arbitrary stages of growth, or to tackle particular challenges or take particular actions? If so, I’d argue $500M revenue and 25% CAGR without good BU/GTM alignment is a pretty clear indicator this has legs.\n\n · In any event, at each stage of growth, we can expect increases in metrics such as:\n ○ Usage growth by product \n ○ Revenue and revenue growth and/or profitability/losses\n · By business line\n · By ecosystem partner (reselling our offerings)\n ○ Degree of sales enablement (# DS sales certifications earned, % of reps whose DS deals comprise y% of their revenue) \n ○ Degree of sales ease (# people who have to touch each deal, average deal time by revenue band, % revenue from PLG)\n ○ Support systems: We can't scale without a simple, effective and measurable support experience for users and customers. We should measure the key metrics and outcomes (by persona type (describing product affinity): NPS and NPS-T , by product: mean time to resolution, mean number of handoffs to resolution) against the best in the industry.\n ○ Marketing: % of marketing budget allocated to DS; CAC/LTV by products\n ○ Consumption of our services by ecosystem partners, by each major category of ecosystem partner\n ○ Community adoption (for open source offerings)\n · The point, though, is that these targets will change every year.

Your first task is to perform the above on the following text \" Absence Impedes Communication\n\nA manager often creates communication problems by not being reasonably accessible. When employees are forced either to wait to get answers or to take chances and act independently, time and material resources are wasted through delay and error. This may be especially troublesome in emergencies when time must be devoted to tracking down a missing manager.\n\nEmployees should perceive a department manager as the employees’ direct conduit when communicating with other organizational elements. This is especially true for interactions with higher management. Employees may perceive a manager who is not readily visible or available as being uninterested and uncaring. This is true for supervisors who seem dedicated primarily to activities such as meetings, committee work, conferences, and the like that occur outside of a department. Such activities put strain on the relationship between supervisor and employees, and the employees begin to see such a supervisor as indifferent and impersonal. For many members of a working group, their department manager is a representative of the organization itself. This supervisor is the member of management that these employees know best and may be the only member of management with whom they have a speaking relationship. If employees perceive their supervisor as being cold, uncaring, and impersonal, then they are likely to perceive the entire organization in the same manner. In most instances, a first-line manager is a worker as well as a manager. These supervisory responsibilities provide an additional resource for a department.

{"question": "Make a summary of te following text:\nThe history of geometric algebra is one of the more unusual tales in the development\nof mathematical physics. William Kingdon Clifford introduced his\ngeometric algebra in the 1870s, building on the earlier work of Hamilton and\nGrassmann. It is clear from his writing that Clifford intended his algebra to\ndescribe the geometric properties of vectors, planes and higher-dimensional objects.\nBut most physicists first encounter the algebra in the guise of the Pauli\nand Dirac matrix algebras of quantum theory. Few then contemplate using these\nunwieldy matrices for practical geometric computing. Indeed, some physicists\ncome away from a study of Dirac theory with the view that Clifford’s algebra\nis inherently quantum-mechanical. In this book we aim to dispel this belief by\ngiving a straightforward introduction to this new and fundamentally different\napproach to vectors and vector multiplication.

{"question": "list the top 4 points made in this text: The search for truth is as old as civilisation. After centuries of “truth” being determined\nby religious authorities, the first information revolution in the West – the invention of the\nprinting press – democratised reading and learning. Post-Enlightenment democracies\nwould come to champion the open forum as the landscape for discovery. Truth and reason\ncould only be sought by allowing conflicting ideas to meet and be tested - and as such,\neven heresy could be seen by liberals as a virtue, not a sin. Technology had democratised\ntruth from fists of institutional power.\nBut our current technological revolution has redefined both the relationship between\npeople and power, and truth and power. Whilst billions of people across the globe can\nspeak to the world instantaneously, a handful of billionaires define the parameters of what\nthey can and cannot say. The internet has given rise to the possibility of the greatest\ndemocratisation of information in the history of humankind, and the greatest control of\ninformation and speech. As the open forum has been magnified, so too has the desire for\ncontrol by those who, whether benevolently or not, seek the power to define its limitations.\nThe preservation of “truth” has re-emerged as a motivation for censorship on the internet’s\nopen forums. The internet contains masses of incorrect information – but this is a defining\nfeature of an open forum, not a flaw. John Milton wrote in his 1644 essay Areopagitica,\n“Let [Truth] and Falsehood grapple; whoever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and\nopen encounter?” Almost four centuries later, faced with technological dystopia, we find\nourselves having to make this foundational liberal argument afresh. As former Supreme\nCourt judge Lord Sumption wrote, arguing against a particularly censorious version of the\ngovernment’s Online Safety Bill,\n“We have to accept the implications of human curiosity. Some of what people\nsay will be wrong. Some of it may even be harmful. But we cannot discover truth\nwithout accommodating error. It is the price that we pay for allowing knowledge and\nunderstanding to develop and human civilisation to progress.”1\nThe basis of a belief in freedom of expression and its necessity for democracy is not only\nthat truth can withstand the mistruths that exist in an open forum, but that it requires it\n– the discovery of truth and the and evolution of knowledge is served by the most open\npossible forum.\nAs with almost all authoritarian arguments, modern pro-censorship views are partly defined\n1 The hidden harms in the Online Safety Bill – Jonathan Sumption, The Spectator, 20 August\n2022: https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-hidden-harms-in-the-online-safety-bill/\n1\nby exceptionalism. Technocrats argue that the digital revolution poses exceptional, new\nthreats and that the ability for people to post incorrect information or harmful views on\nsuch a far-reaching platform, without the gatekeeping associated with the printing press’\ninformation revolution, makes wrong information particularly pernicious - even if is lawful.\nThe solution often offered to tackle the scourge of “misinformation” is censorship, in one\nform or another. From de-ranking certain content to taking down posts or directing people\nto approved information sources, the antidote to misinformation has been posed as giving\nthose with power the ability to control speech further. In doing so, enormous power over\nthe public’s freedom of expression has been seized in a swift and silent coup – first by Big\nTech corporations, then by governments, and increasingly, by a convergence of the two.\nWhilst presented as in the public interest, these censorship “solutions” centralise\npowerful interests, positioning them the arbiters of truth. The misinformation industry,\ncombining Big Tech companies, governments, international governance organisations\nand start-up “fact-checker” style organisations present themselves as the judges and\njuries of information, determining the parameters of acceptable speech.\nIt is the growing confluence of power between Big Tech and state powers that is the\nsubject of our investigation, and this report.\nFour key units operate out of Whitehall as the government’s social media special forces,\neach with a distinct purpose.\nThe Rapid Response Unit (RRU), part of the Cabinet Office, was tasked with “tackling a\nrange of harmful narratives online” during the pandemic, “from purported ‘experts’ issuing\ndangerous misinformation, to criminal fraudsters running phishing scams”.2\nThe Counter Disinformation Unit (CDU), which was tasked to monitor what it deems to be\ndisinformation and flags content to social media companies, sits inside the Department\nfor Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Whilst the Government’s use of these terms appears\nto be very loose, misinformation refers to any type of inaccurate information whereas\ndisinformation refers to deliberate false information, often spread with malicious intent.3\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, the Foreign Office established the Government\nInformation Cell (GIC) focused on identifying and countering Russian disinformation in\nthe UK and abroad about the Kremlin’s war.\nMeanwhile, the Home Office’s Research, Intelligence and Communications Unit (RICU)\n2 Government cracks down on spread of false coronavirus information online – Cabinet\nOffice, UK Government, 30th March 2020: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-cracksdown-\non-spread-of-false-coronavirus-information-online\n3 Factsheet 4: Types of Misinformation and Disinformation – UNHCR, February 2002: https://\nwww.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Factsheet-4.pdf\n2\noperates to push official lines that support counter-extremism and has even set up\ndomestic front organisations to publish propaganda.\nA further unit is purported to actively counter “disinformation” within the Ministry of\nDefence – the 77th Brigade, which is “a combined Regular and Army Reserve unit” which\naims to “challenge the difficulties of modern warfare using non-lethal engagement and\nlegitimate non-military levers as a means to adapt behaviours of the opposing forces and\nadversaries”.4 However, our investigation, which includes an exclusive whistleblower\naccount, reveals that the reality of the unit’s activities is far different.\nAll of these units operate in the shadows and are rarely forthcoming about their capabilities,\nactivities or reach, with the CDU being the least forthcoming with answers to transparency\nquestions. This is despite the CDU being part of the government department responsible\nfor the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Huge sums of public money, running into the\ntens of millions of pounds, have been spent on these units which have the potential\nto influence discussion online and even news reporting. It is dangerous for freedom of\nspeech and democracy for unaccountable officials to be empowered to shape online\ndiscourse, yet the government refuses to answer questions about the topics they monitor\nor accounts they flag to platforms.\nBig Brother Watch has submitted numerous FOIA requests to the government about the\nfour units, analysed a further tranche", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "1.

{"question": "Summarize the following.\nTitle: \"The Most Powerful ENERGY in The Universe - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"the study of the magnetic powers of the Sun will be more or less clearly understood by the study of the seasons winter summer spring and these things have all to do with a magnetic factor in the air and we think of it only as in trying to explain it as a physical astronomical phenomena since there's the rotation and Revolutions of the Sun and planets but each of these planets is a field of magnetic energy and this energy comes to us through what we call Air [Music] now what is air actually well we have scientific definitions of it but there's something more to it than that air is something in itself it is a substance it is not only a condition of climate or of weather it is a basic factor in the contributions which make up existence one thing we have learned from television is that air transmits we know for instance that we can have all kinds of programs on the air at the same time and they can come from all directions and they can overlap and interlap but each one will remain separately identified as though it was moving in a Channel or Circuit of its own you can have a dozen programs if you turn them on turn them off but none of those programs is going through the air in the form we see it and we see the murder committed on the screen and we see it broadcast into a theater somewhere or into a home but it isn't the murder that's going into the home if the murder has not been visible when it went through the air something went through was vibration and this vibration in the magnetic field can be divided into an infinite complexity of separate emanation in other words if we had a thousand different channels they could be differentiated in the magnetic fields so that each one would be broadcast correctly and properly for whatever it is thus we realize there's something out there besides air something beside helium and oxygen something beside the ordinary factors we take into consideration scientifically we are in the presence of a mysterious agent an agent that is part of everything that we are now studying magnetism as it comes into the human body we discover along with Kilda that each human body is surrounded by an etheric of energy field this energy field is sometimes referred to as an aura but it is not the true order that we think of in metaphysics this magnetic field is an area of energy this area of energy it forms an egg-like atmospheric sheath around the physical body usually extending three to five feet from it in each Direction this energy Fields is the basis of virtue because this energy field Depends for its reality its serviceability and its protecting power to mood emotion thought and the attitudes of the person around which this magnetic field is gathered in other words the individual if they are normal if mentally emotionally and physically they are keeping the rules this magnetic field forms a tremendous protection it is normal it is healthy it is constantly able to handle infections and all kinds of difficulties it will help to heal wounds it will help to recover the use of functions and organs and if we are deprived of some part of the body it will try to compensate for us as long as the individual takes proper care of his magnetic field it will serve him now this is by phase of morality that is generally overlooked it is assumed that these magnetic fields are something you don't pay much attention to but the truth of the matter is the whole survival of the individual depends upon maintaining the Integrity of this flow of energy into the magnetic field this energy comes from the sun it comes through a mysterious energy tube in the magnetic field it enters the individual through the crown of the head it disseminates through the entire body and it's excreted back again through the lower centers of the body and is reclansed by the solar energy this is a kind of a little private tank or capsule of life that we are all caring about with us all the time now the problem of Morality In this is very definite the moment we break rules we damage that magnetic flow we have got to keep the laws of nature and these in turn are the laws of God or the magnetic field fails it can fail because of physical interferences which reduce its integrity and reduce its power it can be wasted in riotous living which is such a common cause these days it can be variously destroyed by moods by Attitudes by fears by complexes it can be destroyed or damaged by alcohol drugs narcotics all kinds of things but if this field is damaged it immediately reacts into Health it damages the individual's Vitality it makes him more easily subject to contagions and infections and it definitely shortens the life expectancy now if this is the soul why do we want to consider it as a moral Factor in other words what is morality to the Ancients it was obedience to the word the words of God or the laws of God in more modern times with more intelligent people it is obedience with the evident will of deity as manifested in creation virtualize in whatever builds up the magnetic fields Vice is that which tears them down no human interception can interfere with this in any way therefore if we are good is not because the book says we should be is not because it was funded by the laws on Sinai it is because we keep the rules of the integration of the human structure that we use the magnetic fields correctly and protect our health and our happiness and our well-being in that way now we think of the magnetic field of surrounding the entire structure of the body as kilna shows in his work on the human atmosphere and have it also in his study of the atom this however is only a phase of it each part of the body has a magnetic field each unit within the individual has its survival in a unit of energy and this unit of energy is present in the smallest subdivision of imaginable space it is in the tiniest atom there is no such a thing as a dead particle in the universe even if it is killed by something the very disintegrating process is a symbol of Life Energy therefore we have confronted with the natural problem of realizing that virtue is to keep the law of the energy field now the law of the energy field just by coincidence is also the law of integrity the energy field is what establishes right and wrong the energy TPL tells us that to lose our disposition and temporary fit is wrong to use various negative destructive attitudes is wrong to compromise the principles of right living is wrong to think badly to feel unpleasantly to be engaged in any action or concept which is contrary to the common good damages the magnetic field and therefore is wrong the stomach has its own magnetic field the stomach is not simply an organ it is an organism it is a living thing within the human body the same is true of the heart the brain the glandular structure all the organs the intestines all the motor system the nervous system the endocrine system these are all entities they are entities of magnetic unities they are part of living organisms that you're cooperating together for the common good to abuse one is to damage all to neglect one is to neglect all each of these organs has its own field in the body and all these fields together constitute the grand magnetic field that surrounds the complete person now then we go inside of this for a moment to see what we're dealing with so we go back to Pythagoras who was very timely in that he tells us that in Egypt there was a temple in which therapy was a result of this contemplation of a symmetrical geometric solids in other words the images of therapy were mathematical cubes octagons each one placed upon a kind of all a pedestal for the contemplation of the Sephora all the symmetric geometric solids perfect and complete instructor to look upon them was therapeutic because look to look upon them accepted their energy as a reality in our lives now these Stone solids apparently were not alive they only gave the impression of value but actually they were alive every form in nature natural or artificial has a magnetic field from the tiniest atom to the greatest galaxy the magnetic fields are present and the rules of each of them must be obeyed now if an individual looking at a geometric solid C is in it a perfect proportion this realization enters into the subconscious life of the person the imagery of that solid is sent into the Consciousness in the form of a benevolent magnetic Center it means that the individual is seeing Harmony is seeing something in perfect order and perfect correctness wherevers we see Perfection it improves ourselves wherever we accept Discord is inevitable it injures ourselves everywhere looking around us in nature we see that all natural things are benevolent it is only when these are abused mostly by Humanity that these benevolences are lost we live in a completely corrupt world therefore we are bewildered we are intimidated we are worried and very often just simply give up and follow the line of least resistance and go down with the rest now this isn't really the way it was intended to be actually the the bad news that we have has nothing to do with us unless we're part of the bad program now you might say it's nicer to imagine a world in which we could all work together there's no doubt about it there'll be much better but until such time the individual who is trying to be right has got to be careful that he is not infected by a common disillusionment he cannot afford to say everything is wrong and mean it he's got to hold inside of himself a realization the principle is the basic value and that regardless of what happens in the world he cannot lose sight of protecting his own energy resources because it might just so happen that he could be one of those who could help to change the course of history in other words disillusionment despair discouragement bitterness anger frustration all these do nothing to the person against whom they are turned but they do everything to the individual who uses them therefore no matter what we read in the inside of himself a realization the principle is the basic value and that regardless of what happens in the world he cannot lose sight of protecting his own energy resources because it might just so happen that he could be one of those who could help to change the cours can't do it badly and be well off but until such time values never change never will we be punished what somebody else does never will we be rewarded for the virtues of others we must achieve these things ourselves through our own efforts through our own integrities and through our own dedications and all of this is added up in a mysterious bank account which is called energy or magnetic resource it is there to serve us it is there to serve the individual who does wrong but if the individual does wrong the service collapses and the that his own honesty is his only will all else is some kind of a delusion which will ultimately turn back and with him so in the quiet Dune and peace of the realization of the immutability of good the inevitability of right or wrong the endless and continuous process of redemption going through every area of nature all things in due time will we come back into the peace which they sacrificed when they tried to put self as an individual above Universal reality as we look around us there's every reason to know that we live in a resources will be reduced we're worried now about changes taking place in the atmosphere that the overload that we are throwing against our natural resources is beginning to endanger us we cannot afford to waste the magnetic field of the body or destroy it any more than we can afford to destroy the one of the earth if we are going to run out of petroleum someday we're also going to run out of the ability to recuperate from ailments if we dispose of and waste our recuperative power the magnetism which magnetism because it's magnetism in the food that feeds us it's magnetism in the air that we breathe is a magnetism in the earth that grows our vegetables and it is magnetism in our souls it makes us hope for good all the things we not all the things we believe in are energy dependent and the use of energy is the most important thing why we go on year after year making all kinds of efforts to feel better be better or think better and Overlook the one fact that everything that we think and feel and believe depends upon a life weed we have been given a beautiful planet we subdivide it and sold it for profits the original purpose was that we should become a wonderful group of human beings working together for the good of each other and the glory of the universe we are being prepared for a bigger job than we have when we are flunking the examination at the present moment we are not doing what we should do everything that comes along is measured in profit everything it comes along is majored in Freedom from responsibility when energy is something that we must be all these things are all little things but they all add up to the loss and waste of magnetic resource they are the failure of the individual to protect the source of his own life the source of his own future and the breaking of the laws and rules by which he must compare his own needs with the needs of others it is only when we work to protect the Toadstool as well as the nation that we can have peace in the world we must protect the small things because each of them is a run energy resource the protection of them is games out of them silly games games in which we think we're

[ \\_\\_ ] chat GPT [ \\_\\_ ] this scares the [ \\_\\_ ] out of me what's your people what do you mean your favorite people you whack your routers what have you done yeah super interesting and fascinating language models I don't know if you know what those are but that's the general uh systems that uh on July child GPT and GPT they've been progressing over the past maybe four years aggressively there's been a lot of development GPT one gpt2 gpt3 uh gbt 3.5 and Chad gbt there's a lot of interesting technical stuff that maybe we don't want to get into sure let's get into it well I'm fascinated by it it's a Chad GPT is based on fundamentally on a 175 billion uh parameter neural network that is gpt3 and the rest is what data is it trained on and how is it trained so you already have like a brain a giant neural network and it's just trained in different ways so Chad uh GPT 3 came out about two years ago and it was like impressive but dumb in a lot of ways it was like you would expect as a human being for it to generate certain kinds of text and it was like saying kind of dumb things that were off and you're like all right this is really impressive but it's not quite there you can tell it's not intelligent and what they did with uh GPT 3. 5 is they started adding more and different kinds of data sets there one of them probably the smartest neural network currently is codex which is fine-tuned for programming like it was it was uh trained on code on programming code and when you train a programming code which chat GPT is also you're teaching it something like reasoning because it's no longer information and knowledge from the Internet it's also reasoning you can like logic even though you're looking at code programming code is you're looking at me like what the [ \\_\\_ ] is he talking about no no no no that's not what I'm looking at I'm looking at you like oh my God but reasoning is a in order to be able to stitch together sentences that make sense you not only need to know the facts that on July those sentences you also have to be able to reason yeah and we think of it we take it for granted as human beings that we can do some common sense reasoning like like this war started at this date and ended at this date therefore it means that uh like the start and the end has a meaning there's a temporal consistency there's a cause and effect all of those things are inside programming code by the way a lot of stuff I'm saying we still don't understand we're like intuiting why this works so well really these are the intuitions yeah there's a lot of stuff they're not clear so Chad so GPT 3. 5 which Chad GPT is likely based on there's no paper yet so we don't know exactly the the details but it was just trained on on code and more data that's able to give it some reasoning then this is really important it was fine-tuned in a supervised Way by human labeling small data set by human labeling of here's what we would like this network to generate here's the stuff that makes sense here's the kind of dialogue that makes sense here's the kind of answers to questions that make sense it's basically pointing this giant Titanic of a neural network into the right direction that aligns with the way human beings think and talk so it's not just using the giant wisdom of uh Wikipedia and just I can talk about what data sets this train on but just basically the internet it was pointed in the wrong direction so this uh supervised labeling allows it to point in the right direction to when it says [ \\_\\_ ] you're like holy [ \\_\\_ ] that's pretty smart so that that's the alignment and then they did uh something really interesting is using reinforcement learning uh based on labeling data from humans this that's quite a large data set the task is the following you have this smart DPT 3.5 thing generate a bunch of text and humans label which one seems the best so ranking like you ask it a question of for example you could do uh generate a joke in a style of Joe Rogan right and you have a label that has five options and you have a label as I mentioned dick and [ \\_\\_ ] I don't know how exactly but uh so you get it to rank the the human label is just over just sitting there there's a very large number of them they're working full-time they're labeling the ranking of the outputs of this model and that kind of ranking used together with a technique called reinforcement learning is able to get this thing to generate very impressive to humans output so it's not actually there's not a significant breakthrough in how much knowledge was learned that was already in gpt3 and there was much more impressive models already trained so it's on the way not just open AI but this kind of fighting fine tuning is called by human labelers plus reinforcement learning you start to get like like where uh students don't have to write essays anymore in high school yeah where you can style transfer like I said uh do a uh Louis CK joke install Joe Rogan or Joe Joe Rogan joke and the style of Lucy K and does an incredible job at those kinds of style transfers you can uh more accurately query things about the different historical events all that kind of stuff how far away are we from something like chat GPT being impossible to detect whether or not it's a person or whether it's chat GPT well it depends who is playing with it I think we're not that far away in terms of capability but in order to use these systems and rather in order to train these systems you have to be a large company and large companies tend to get scared when it's doing interesting stuff really well they tend to want to even currently with chat GPT it's become a lot less interesting interesting spoken in a Bukowski Hunter S Thompson kind of interesting because the companies are kind of censoring it you don't want it to have any kind of controversial opinions you don't want it to be too edgy you don't want it to be real too like if I ask it how do I build the bomb because I want to destroy the world we wanted to prevent that how about how do I uh uh I don't know convince I don't know anything about this but how do I convince a dude or a girl to sleep with me and go like anything I'm just off the top of my head anything you start to get nervous imagine if you're a company how do I want people to use this kind of system

{"question": "Introduction to Psychodynamic Theory in Social Work\nSocial workers balance many clients suffering from a wide range of problems, including trauma, medical conditions, mental health issues, unemployment, lack of education, discrimination, criminal records and more. Pursuing a degree in social work prepares a student to become a practitioner and to help their clients through counseling and social support systems.\n\nSocial workers base their practices on several theories and practice models, including psychodynamic theory. What once was a theory derived from Sigmund Freud is now a network of theories developed and expanded by many theorists since the early 1900s. Psychodynamic theory, also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, helps clients understand their emotions and unconscious patterns of behavior. By talking through these emotions and behaviors with a social worker, clients come to know themselves better and make better decisions for themselves.\n\nWhat is Psychodynamic Theory?\nPsychodynamic theory was originally a theory of personality created by FreudExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. It has evolved significantly over the years, and many theorists have contributed to it. Freud believed human behavior could be explained by intrapsychic processes and interpersonal patterns outside of a person’s conscious awareness and based on their childhood experiences. A general definition of psychodynamic theory is that forces outside of a person’s awareness explain why they behave a certain way.\n\nToday psychodynamic theory is not a unified theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. Instead, there are many related theories regarding human development and personality. These different theories have various treatment processes, some of which are used by social workers and other clinicians, like talk therapy, dream analysis, free association and transference.\n\nHow psychodynamic theory differs from other types of therapy\nMany modern types of therapyExternal link:open\\_in\\_new emphasize mitigating or getting rid of the symptoms of a problem. For example, if a person struggles with anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy helps a person address the symptoms of their anxiety. Psychodynamic theory, however, explores a person’s deeply rooted drives, needs and desires. It’s considered a more global approach to therapy than a modern, problem-based therapy. You also can look at it as a difference between focusing on a person’s emotions versus their behavior.\n\nThe Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual\nModern psychology and psychiatry use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)External link:open\\_in\\_new. The Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM) was published in 2006 as an alternative or additional guide for clinicians to diagnose and treat clients. It was sponsored by:\n\nThe American Psychoanalytic AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe International Psychoanalytical AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe Division of Psychoanalysis of the American Psychological AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry\nThe National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social WorkExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe second edition was published in 2016, and also was sponsored by the International Association for Relational Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy.\n\nA Brief History of Psychodynamic Theory\nMany professionals have contributed to psychodynamic theory and its relationship to social work over the years. The theory has evolved significantly, and it is still part of modern social work. The National Association of Social Workers’ Standards for Clinical Social Work in Social Work Practice (PDF, XX)External link:open\\_in\\_new lists it as one of several theories social workers can use as a basis for their practices.\n\nThe evolution of psychodynamic theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new can be understood through four schools of thought:\n\n1. Drive theory\nFreud believed a person’s behavior was the result of several drives including the sex (eros), self-preservation and destruction/aggression (death) drives. The id is the primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains the foundation of these drives. It is the instinctive portion of a personality.\n\nAs a child develops, external forces from the world make it difficult to satisfy these drives. Eventually, the superego and ego impose internal hurdles and restraints. The superego is responsible for the morals of society as taught by a person’s parents, operating as a moral conscience. The ego mediates between the id and the external world—it is responsible for decision-making.\n\nWhen a person’s drive-based desires might become conscious, it triggers a conflict between the drives and the superego or the ego. When a person fails to repress their desires, it creates anxiety and activates defense mechanisms.\n\n2. Ego psychology\nTheories on how a person’s ego functions have evolved since Freud. He believed the ego developed from the id alone. But theorists later believed the ego did more than regulate a person’s drives. Some theorists believed the ego developed autonomously—free of intrapsychic conflict. They believed people had another drive to explore and control the world around them. According to ego psychology, a person’s environment and reality were also important to their development.\n\n3. Object relations theory\nPsychodynamic theory originally saw behavior as a function of drives. Later, theorists explained people’s behavior based on object seeking. People were shaped by their relationships with significant others around them, like their parents and siblings. Under this theory, a person’s struggles have to do with their focus on maintaining relationships with others while also differentiating themselves. As adults, people repeat object relationships they formed in childhood.\n\n4. Self psychology\nUnder this theory, a person’s perception of themself is in relation to their boundaries or differences (or lack thereof) from others. Theorists believe narcissism has a healthy place in development and adulthood, though narcissism isn’t to be confused with narcissistic personality disorder. A person with a lack of self-esteem or an undeveloped sense of self might experience mental health issues. A person with a healthy sense of self can self-regulate and soothe and is resilient. Some theorists believe a lack of a sense of self came from a lack of parental empathy during childhood.\n\nAssumptions of Psychodynamic Theory\nThere are several key assumptions in psychodynamic theory:\n\nAll behavior has an underlying cause.\nThe causes of a person’s behavior originate in their unconscious.\nDifferent aspects of a person’s unconscious struggle against each other.\nAn adult’s behavior and feelings, including mental health issues, are rooted in childhood experiences.\nBoth innate, internal processes and the external environment contribute to adult personality.\nGoals of psychodynamic theory\nPsychodynamic therapy pushes for clients to:\n\nAcknowledge their emotions. Over time, clients can start to recognize patterns in their emotions and address them, which can lead to making better choices.\nIdentify patterns. Clients can begin to see patterns in more than just their emotions, but also their behaviors and relationships. Or, if clients are aware of negative patterns in their life, therapy can help them understand why they make certain choices and give them the power to change.\nImprove interpersonal relationships. Modern psychodynamic theory helps clients understand their relationships, as well as patterns they exhibit with relationships.\nRecognize and address avoidance. Everyone has automatic ways of avoiding bad thoughts and feelings. Therapy can help clients recognize when they’re acting in a way to avoid distress and how to move forward addressing their emotions with healthy coping mechanisms.\nStrengths and weaknesses of psychodynamic theory\nThere are several strengths to psychodynamic theory. It recognizes that a person’s childhood impacts their mental health as an adult. This idea is readily accepted in modern psychology and social work.\n\nIt recognizes that an adult is the product of both nature and nurture. People have internal drives that influence their behavior. Childhood experiences affect them, too.\n\nFreud’s psychodynamic theory also led to psychoanalysis, which used talking as a way to identify and treat mental health conditions. Conversation is a fundamental aspect of therapy today. When you think of a clinician asking a client, “How does that make you feel?” that’s psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis.\n\nThere are recognized weaknesses of psychodynamic theory. It doesn’t account for a person’s ability to think and control their behavior. Many theorists believe it doesn’t consider free will enough.\n\nIt’s considered unscientific because it’s difficult to prove. The theories are largely unsubstantiated. But modern medical advances have provided supporting evidence for the benefits of psychodynamic therapy.\n\nHow Does Psychodynamic Theory Apply to Social Work?\nSocial workers can benefit from applying the fundamental assumptions of psychodynamic theory to their clients. Every client’s behavior has a reason. It isn’t random or happening in a vacuum. Their behavior also is likely partly or mostly in response to unconscious processes. The client might not realize why they behave a certain way.\n\nObject relations theory and self-psychology moved psychodynamic theory from a one-person issue, focused on the unconscious issues of an individual, to two-person psychology, focused on relationships. This fits well with social work. Social workers often focus on a client’s interpersonal relationships, including the client-worker relationship, to learn about the client’s behavior and promote change.\n\nSocial workers often work with clients with multiple difficulties. Psychodynamic theory in social work provides a conceptual framework for understanding seemingly unrelated symptoms or patterns of behavior. The framework of theories offers social workers a way to address all of the client’s issues.\n\nSocial workers hope to promote change and improvement in a client’s life. By using psychodynamic therapy, they can help clients get to the root of their thoughts, emotions and behaviors. This provides a chance for self-discovery. A client has the opportunity to learn more about themselves, recognize harmful patterns of emotions or in relationships and alter their behavior.\n\nTypes of psychodynamic treatments\nThere are many different treatments social workers can use as part of a psychodynamic approach to modern types of therapyExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. The psychotherapy will focus mostly on talking. Clinicians let the client’s direct the conversation, but other techniques can be complementary to talk therapy including:\n\nTransference: A person redirects their feelings and expectations of one person onto another—usually unconsciously. Transference is common in therapy. The client applies emotions toward their clinician and acts toward them as if they were the other person. Transference can happen in a variety of relationships, and it doesn’t necessarily demonstrate a mental health issue. When a social worker identifies and understands the client’s transference, they can gain a better understanding of a part of the client’s life and their condition.\n\nFree association: A clinician might encourage a client to write down or speak all the thoughts that come to their mind. It might be an incoherent stream of words. It might be a random assortment of memories and emotions. The purpose of free association is to make connections between topics that might go unnoticed. This was originally developed by Freud, though it’s not a common therapy technique today.\n\nDream analysis: Freud also developed the technique of analyzing dreams as a way of learning more about a person’s unconscious. Modern psychodynamic clinicians use dream analysis as part of person-centered therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and Gestalt therapy (in Gestalt therapy, there’s the belief that dreams are messages a person sends themselves.)\n\nCriticism of Psychodynamic Theory\nPsychodynamic theory has been criticized as being too deterministic or victim-blaming to be used in modern psychology and social workExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. The original theories believed people had no control over their own behavior. There was a lack of personal agency.\n\nAnother criticism of psychodynamic theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new, as defined by Freud, is that it is sexist. Freud believed women were inferior to men. He also believed men had stronger superegos. Women’s weaker superegos made them more prone to anxiety. It’s important to remember that Freud predominantly treated and studied middle-aged women in Vienna.\n\nIn more recent decades, psychodynamic theory has been criticized as not only sexist but also not a sufficient theory or treatment for people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nPsychodynamic theory originally didn’t account for social issues like sexism, racism, poverty and homophobia. Some practitioners felt psychodynamic theory focused too much on psychotherapy treatment rather than addressing broader social concerns. In other words, practitioners focused on finding the underlying, personal cause of a client’s problems instead of addressing larger social systems that impact the client.\n\nThis is a particular concern for social workers who identify social justice as a core value of their profession.

{"question": "Can you summarise the below email between Meredith and the Owners using not more than 200 words. Also Refer to Meredith as \"MZ\" and Joshua and Haley as the 'Owners' :\n\nHi Joshua and Hayley,\n\n1. Please find attached a spreadsheet laying out the positions of your expert and the Builder's expert in relation to your claim for defective work and overpayments under the Contract, and the Builder's claim for unpaid variations.\n\n2. You will see from the spreadsheet that your best outcome at hearing (being you win 100% and the Builder does not succeed at all) is that the Builder would be required to pay you $226,979.64 (plus your costs on an indemnity basis from the expiry of your offer on 23 August 2022).\nHowever, the Builder's best outcome (the Builder is 100% successful and you do not succeed at all) would be that you would pay him $54,983.18 (plus his costs on an indemnity basis from the expiry of his offer on 20 May 2022).\nThese amounts take into account the items the experts agree on in their respective reports.\nThe most likely scenario at hearing will be that you will achieve somewhere between those two amounts.\n\n3. Based on the information that we have to date, bearing in mind the experts have not conducted a joint conclave yet, we have conservatively estimated a likely outcome for you at the final hearing would be for the Builder to pay you approximately $150,000-$160,000. This takes into account partial success for your claim and partial success for the Builder's claim. However, as you are aware litigation is inherently uncertain and therefore we can make no representations or guarantees as to what the outcome will be at hearing\n\n4. We also note that the joint expert conclave may very well alter that figure one way or the other. Greg James has advised that he has contacted the expert for the Builder, Peter Shepherd, and they anticipate conducting a conclave on or after 23 March 2023.\n\n5. As you may recall on 23 August 2022, you made an offer for the Builder to pay you $140,000 in full and final settlement of these proceedings. As you are aware that offer was not accepted. Based on our information in paragraphs 3 above and as previously discussed, from a cost protection perspective this offer is below what you are likely to achieve if this matter runs to hearing. Therefore, if you achieve more than $140,000 at final hearing you can still rely on that letter to seek a higher proportion of your costs from the Builder from the date that offer expired.\n\n6. However, we advise that a further review of these figures be undertaken after we receive the joint expert report.\n\n7. I have tried to contact Conrad Curry, the solicitor for the Builder, on a number of occasions since we last spoke but have yet been able to have a conversation with him about the position of the Builder in regards to having informal settlement negotiations. We will continue to reach out to Mr Curry.\n\n8. Going forward based on the above and information to hand you have a number of options.\n\nOption 1\n\nWe wait until after we get the joint conclave report to review the figures again to see if your previous offer is still likely to be beaten at hearing. Then determine whether or not you would like to put on a further offer.\n\nOption 2\n\nWe wait until after we get the joint conclave report to decide whether or not we engage in informal settlement negotiations.\n\nOption 3\n\nWe put on a further offer for the Builder to pay $140,000, in full and final settlement. However, the Builder would also be required to pay your costs on an ordinary basis up to the date of the expiry of this second letter. The compromise is that you would be accepting a lower proportion of your costs from the expiry date of your first offer on 23 August 2022 to the expiry date of the second letter, then you would be entitled to if you relied on your first letter and beat that offer at the final hearing.\n\nOption 4\n\nWe do nothing and rely on the first offer as it stands and proceed to hearing.\n\nPlease review the spreadsheet and feel free to contact us if you would like to discuss it or the above further.\n\nThank you\n\nBest regards\n\nMeredith Ziegler", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "Summary:\n\nMZ (Meredith Ziegler) provided the Owners with a spreadsheet outlining the positions of their expert and the Builder's expert regarding the defective work, overpayments, and unpaid variations claims.

MZ advised that the joint expert conclave may alter this figure. \n\nMZ reminded the Owners of their previous offer of $140,000 to the Builder, which was not accepted. MZ outlined four options moving forward: 1) Wait for the joint conclave report and review figures, 2) Wait for the report and decide on informal settlement negotiations, 3) Make a new $140,000 offer with cost implications, or 4) Proceed to the hearing relying on the first offer."}

{"question": "Title: \"How to Get Ahead of 98% of People (In 12 Months) - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"here's how to get ahead of 98 of people in the next 12 months first you have to become aggressively aware of your current situation and you have to actually cultivate a hate for it let me explain what I mean just like a fighter when he goes into the ring he has an extraordinary energy that he puts toward his opponent trying to destroy him but after the fight they shake hands they say great fight well done but they're able to turn on and turn off that chip on their shoulder and harness that energy so that they can deploy it when it's necessary so for you in whatever your Pursuits are over the next 12 months when you're actually in fight mode act as if you're in fight mode develop a chip on your shoulder and when I say become aggressively aware of your current situation I mean take a pen and a piece of paper and write down everything in your life that you do not want think of everything in your income in your business if you have one in your health in your relationships in your finances everything you have to look at that list and say that I do not want that you have to write a list of reasons as to why you do not want that why specifically don't you want that income why is that Health situation unacceptable anymore why is that relationship no longer serving you why is that absolutely where you do not want to be and then ask yourself why on those questions as well yes it is a negative energy but you're going to put it towards a positive productive outcome and now that you have this list of all of the things that you do not want and why you do not want them Write the opposite on another sheet of paper the exact opposite of that entire list that you created and why you want those things see in our minds it's a lot easier for us to come up with what we don't want than what we do want but the secret here is you have to have a goal that you do want that you are striving towards you want to make a list of those things as well and then you're going to declare all out war on making that happen you're going to say no to absolutely everything in your life that is not moving you closer towards those goals you're going to say no to the relationships the way that you spend your time the way that you operate your business you're going to say no to 99.9 of things that you're currently saying yes to you're probably in a place in your life if you want to get to the next level where you don't want to be and that is because you have been saying yes to all of the things that are keeping you there so we have to start saying no and it's going to be very uncomfortable and as you start saying no yes you will probably lose people out of your life yes you will probably lose circumstances out of your life that is what happens when you want to get ahead of other people to get ahead of other people you cannot be around those other people and you have to lock yourself into full Focus mode into full dark mode success is more about what you say no to than what you say yes to and as you begin executing on these things you're going to be focusing on the fundament rentals not fancy stuff the fundamentals just like any High performing athlete they Master the fundamentals before they move on to the fancy stuff success is not sexy it is not fancy it is doing the boring fundamentals over time one after the other after the other and boring monotonous repetition that's just how it works if you're chasing quick wins get rich quick stuff fast and easy it does not exist and the sooner that you acknowledge that and accept that as truth the sooner that you can lock yourself into focused dark mode and get going on achieving everything that you want in your life before every single game Michael Jordan he wasn't doing between the legs and windmill dunks he started with practicing chest passes chest passes a very kindergarten activity but Michael Jordan understood that the fundamentals are where the game is won so if you are not mastering the fundamentals of communication in your relationships the fundamentals of Finance the fundamentals of your business the fun fundamentals of sales influence marketing whatever it is in your life that you're trying to accomplish if you're not where you want to be you are missing the fundamentals and so they're not sexy that's probably why you're not attracted to them but that is the single biggest separator between those who are where they want to be and those who are not anytime there's something wrong with my sales team where they screwed up a call or they failed to close a deal or they failed to hit a Target it's always one hundred percent of the time a lack of a fundamental and I will tell you it will take a lifetime you have to decide that you're going to go into dark mode and lock yourself in to aggressively pursuing your goals and saying no to everything that does not support it and if you have the guts to do that you will be successful if you do not you will not it will not matter what else you do if you do not master the fundamentals you see the longer the time Horizon that you think on the Richer and more successful you will become poor people think on very short-term time Horizon think of a homeless person he's just thinking where can I get my next meal whereas an Elon Musk is thinking thousands of years into the future in terms of the future of human civilization that's why he is worth multiple billions of dollars and the homeless guy is worth a cheeseburger at best so if you're thinking on daily weekly bi-weekly even monthly time Horizons you need to expand your time Horizon on where you're thinking by a factor of like a hundred you need to think on a lifetime and beyond your lifetime time Horizon if you want to accomplish goals that you look back on your life and go wow I can't believe I achieved that that was an amazing journey that does not happen by accident that happens by deliberate design and getting upset with where you are and saying enough is enough with where I'm at I don't care if you're making a thousand dollars a month or a hundred thousand dollars a month if you want to get to the next level at a thousand dollars a month and you want ten thousand dollars a month you have to be disgusted and absolutely horrifying wide at one thousand dollars a month if you're at a hundred thousand dollars a month and you wanna get to a million a month you have to be disgusted and horrified with one hundred thousand dollars a month there is no other way that you are going to be able to lock yourself into a focused declare all-out war state to get to the next level until you cultivate a calculated hate for where you are current so if you do this over the next 12 months you will be Leaps and Bounds above and beyond your competition but if don't apply this you will probably be exactly where you are if not in a worse spot one year from now if you do not apply what I'm sharing with you in this video so if you like these types of videos just let me know in the comments I can pump these out maybe one or two a week and they're a little bit easier for me to produce let me know if you'd like me to do that and like it if you like this video and enjoy the rest of your day [Music] thank you [Music]\"\nSummarize in bulletpoints",

{"question": "Summarise the wikipedia article about Australian box jellyfish and form interesting key points for a school presentation in form of a short list:\n\nChironex fleckeri is the largest of the cubozoans (collectively called box jellyfish), many of which may carry similarly toxic venom. Its bell usually reaches about 16 cm in diameter but can grow up to 35 cm. From each of the four corners of the bell trails a cluster of 15 tentacles. The pale blue bell has faint markings; viewed from certain angles, it bears a somewhat eerie resemblance to a human head or skull. Since it is virtually transparent, the creature is nearly impossible to see in its habitat, posing significant danger to swimmers.\nWhen the jellyfish are swimming, the tentacles contract so they are about 150 mm (5.9 in) long and about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter; when they are hunting, the tentacles are thinner and extend to about 3 m (9.8 ft) long. The tentacles are covered with a high concentration of stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are activated by pressure and a chemical trigger; they react to proteinous chemicals. Box jellyfish are day hunters; at night they are seen resting on the ocean floor.\nIn common with other box jellyfish, C. fleckeri has four eye-clusters with 24 eyes. Some of these eyes seem capable of forming images, but whether they exhibit any object recognition or object tracking is debated; it is also unknown how they process information from their sense of touch and eye-like light-detecting structures due to their lack of a central nervous system. They are attracted to light of different colors (white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue), but blue light seems to elicit a feeding behavior, as it slows down their pulsation rate and makes them stream out their tentacles. Black objects, on the other hand, cause them to move away.\nChironex fleckeri lives on a diet of prawns and small fish and are prey to turtles, whose thick skin is impenetrable to the cnidocytes of the jellyfish.", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "- Chironex fleckeri is the largest of the box jellyfish, with tentacles that can extend up to 3 meters long when hunting.\n- The jellyfish is virtually transparent, making it difficult to see in its habitat and posing a significant danger to swimmers.\n- Box jellyfish are day hunters and rest on the ocean floor at night.\n- They have four eye-clusters with 24 eyes, but it is debated whether they exhibit object recognition or tracking.\n- The jellyfish are attracted to different colored lights, with blue light eliciting a feeding behavior.\n- Their diet consists of prawns and small fish, and they are prey to turtles due to their impenetrable skin."}
{"question": "Based on the findings of the assessment from the field, we conducted KIIs and FGDs from three sampled schools in Banaadir, Kismayo, and Baidoa. The issues that emerged include:\nDiscrimination:\nAccording to the information gathered during the qualitative research, adolescent girls living with disabilities face multiple forms of discrimination in their respective communities. \nDuring the qualitative research, several respondents reported experiencing discrimination due to their disabilities. For example, one respondent stated, \"I have faced a lot of discrimination in my life just because I am disabled. People often treat me differently and don't give me the same opportunities as others.\" Another respondent shared, \"I've faced discrimination from my classmates at school, who call me names and make fun of me. It makes me feel like I don't belong there.\"\n These experiences of discrimination can have a negative impact on the confidence and self-esteem of adolescent girls living with disabilities, making it harder for them to access and succeed in education.\n\nSome manifestations of discrimination and related barriers include: \n1. Stereotypes and negative attitudes: Girls with disabilities reported they encounter negative stereotypes and attitudes from members of their community, which leads to discrimination and exclusion. For example, they may be viewed as being less capable or less intelligent than their non-disabled peers. One girl said \"I wish people would see me for who I am, not just my disability. I have so much to offer, but they never give me a chance.\"\n2. Physical barriers: Girls with disabilities reported they face physical barriers in their community that make it difficult for them to access education or other resources. This can include a lack of infrastructure, such as ramps or elevators, to accommodate their mobility needs. One girl said, \"It's hard for me to participate in community activities because the buildings are not accessible for me.\"\n3. Limited opportunities: Girls with disabilities have limited opportunities for education, employment, or participation in community activities due to discrimination and exclusion. One of the participants during the discussion said, \"I want to be able to contribute to society, but it's hard when you're always excluded and discriminated against. It's hard for most of the girls with disabilities to find a job when they complete education. People discriminate against them because of their disability.\"\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize and address these forms of discrimination in order to create a more inclusive and equal society for adolescent girls living with disabilities in Somalia.

Over 10,000 fiends are bedded in a beautiful realtime 3D environment, complete with snow particles, lighting effect and custom shaders, encouraging the user to share their favourites and keep shaking.\n\nThe main technologies used include Bolt, a custom 3D library developed in-house and a unique Phantom “dude” trained model in Stable Diffusion used to generate the thousands of creatures contained in the experience.\n\n00:14\n00:40\nFIEND GENERATION\nEarly on we had set an ambitious target of including 10,000 unique creatures in the experience and it was obvious that AI image generation was the route to take to complete this task. Our recent experiments with Stable Diffusion meant we knew we could control things like the look, position and colour of the output with some precision.\n\nTo keep the look of the creatures consistent across the experience we trained a model on the Phantom “dude” to inject his DNA into the output from our text prompts.This training was done using Dreambooth, an approach pioneered by our colleagues at Google that allows you to `fine-train` an original model with new concepts.\n\nTo read more about Dreambooth and Textual Inversion check HERE\n\n \nASSET PREPARATION\nUsing this model we went through many rounds of prompt refinement to get a look and feel we were happy with. On the final generation we used img2txt to encourage the output towards the desired layout and colour palette, which really helped bed the fiend into the beautiful Christmas landscape our talented 3D artists had created.\n\nOnce we had generated our pool of creature images from Stable Diffusion we had to extract them to place in the final 3D scene. To do this we wrote a custom pipeline explained below.\n\nWe used Carvekit to automatically isolate the creature and create an alpha channel to bed the creature into the scene. Even though we had some control of the output from IMG2IMG, creatures still appeared at different sizes and positions, so we wrote an additional post-processing step to help standardize and make all the creatures uniform. A custom python script using the OpenCV framework handled this, automatically deleting any creatures that weren’t whole or too small and resizing creatures that were too big. Once this step was complete, the script then placed the fiend in the correct position, and saved out a .png with the correct sequential filename. From this final image we then created a depth map using MiDaS.\n\n00:14\n00:24\nGenerate with Stable Diffusion\nRemove background with Carvekit\nCalculate height and translate island\nCreate depth map with MiDaS\nUse the depth map to offset the geometry on the plane.\nWEBGL\nAt Phantom we have been developing sites with WebGL for a number of years and we felt it was time to dive in and start creating our own custom library. The idea was to develop a bespoke set of tools that prioritises performance with the most minimal amount of code to accomplish the task (30kb gzip core). \n\nFestive Fiends\nFRAMEBUFFER GPGPU SIMULATIONS\nIn order to build simulations that can be run on the GPU we developed a tiny custom module called “fbo-sim”. It provides functionality that swaps framebuffers at each frame update so we can read data from the previous frame and build accumulative effects.\n\nThe background aurora visual uses this module to create the fluid-like effect. Two textures are generated, one for the fluid and one for the mouse velocity. On each frame update the mouse position and velocity is passed to fluid pass to drive the motion.\n\n00:15\n00:17\nThe “fbo-sim” module is not just limited to texture based simulations and the same approach can be used to update particle positions in 3D space. Each particle's position is stored in a 2D floating point texture as RGB colour values: Red = X position, G = Y Position and B = Z position. Using the same swapping mechanism means positions from the last frame can be read in order to update the position for the next frame. When the globe is shaken the snow will flurry by applying a combination of curl noise and a vortex flow field to each particle’s velocity vector. Lastly we have a global time value that can be scaled to add the “bullet time” slow motion effect for the zoom transition.\n\n00:14\n00:16\nCUSTOM SHADERS\nAll of the object materials in the experience are written in custom shaders for that extra degree of control over the art style. Being a low level library, Bolt does not store predefined materials so it is up to the developer to create these from scratch.\n\nThe snow globe glass effect was created by rendering the objects inside the globe to an offscreen texture first that is then sampled using screen UV coordinates in the globe glass shader. This texture sample is then distorted using the globe geometry’s normals for the refraction effect, giving the illusions of thicker glass. \n\n00:14\n00:45\nPOST PROCESSING STACK\nAnother important part of the WebGL visuals is the post processing stack that can be toggled on and off when required. Our tiny “post” module allows multipass shader effects that can be combined or separated per requirements. For this project we only required a single custom blur pass that is used for the zoom effect. A fast Gaussian blur shader is applied to the screen with a masked focus area to create the illusions of depth of field, but a lot faster!\n\n00:01\n00:06\nTHE SNOWGLOBE\nThe snowglobe was modelled and materials added in Blender by the team's 3D artists. Two texture maps were then baked from the materials and lighting, one including the wooden base and the other including the snow and trees. Finally, the model was exported with the baked textures as a GLB and passed to the project 3D developer to implement in the experience with the addition of refraction on the glass.\n\nWith this project, as with all WebGL builds, the team has a series of control panels for crafting and tuning materials, animations, lighting etc. This allows the wider non-technical team to have input into the final configuration to ensure true collaboration between the development and creative teams.\n\nFestive Fiends\nWe built the images above by layering multiple transparent images, to ground our fiend in their environment and add our custom branding to each image. We also created a separate asset perfect for Instagram like social media stories, so our fiends always look their best wherever they are spotted.\n\nFestive Fiends\nNEXT.JS WITH GCP CLOUD STORAGE\n\nFestive Fiends uses the recently released Next JS 13 to generate our website server side, ensuring a fast and responsive experience for all our users. All our fiends have their main image and depth maps stored in a Google Cloud storage bucket, where they’re publically accessible via their respective URL.\n\nWe knew that sharing discovered fiends would be a core part of the experience, and so needed unique and well designed social share assets for each fiend. This would be difficult to traditionally author, as we’ve generated thousands of fiends, and so we reached for Vercel’s OG Image Generation support for dynamically generate assets on the fly.", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "Phantom's Festive Fiends is a fun, addictive holiday website using the latest AI imaging and WebGL technology.

{"question": "summarise the following text into bullet points: Ouch. Sounds like you're having a tough time max. That sucks. I've been there, so I kinda know what you're talking about. I've been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing. It's no bueno. I know. If you don't mind lemme tell you a couple things. You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it. But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don't let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you're just letting us both down. And you don't HAVE to do that. You don't HAVE to do anything. But you get to choose.\n\n(Who am I? My name’s Ryan and I live in Canada. Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below. I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me. When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it’s a way of thanking them. )\n\nRule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What's a zero day? A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that's what you're used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That's rule number one. Do not forget.\n\nLa deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french. its a canadian thing. please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2. BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S. Uh what? 3 me's? That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit. News flash, there are three you's homeslice. There's the past you, the present you, and the future you. If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you's are the key. Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you've done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro. Feeling like shit today? Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday. Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that's all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me's is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend? you do now. You got 2. It's future and past you). Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I'm doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? fuck you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me. I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero). MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better. The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.\n\nRule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn't do it. Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one's for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.\n\nLast rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that's it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to reddit about not caring about yourself? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read \"emotional intelligence\". Read \"From good to great\". Read “thinking fast and slow”. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.\n\nThat’s about it man. There’s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that’s not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey… I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.\n\nI hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can’t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.\n\nHave an awesome fucking day ☺\n\ntldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you’s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional and mental)\n\nEdit: Wow reddit gold? Thanks! No idea what to do with it or whats the deal but many thanks!\n\nEdit2: Someone asked what I meant by \"much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days\". The long and short of it is a simple truth, but it's tough to TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE. It's this: you become what you think. This doesnt mean if I think of a tree, I'll be oakin' it by august. It means that the WAY you think, the THINGS you think of, and the IDEAS YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND defines the sum total that is you. You procrastinate all the time and got fear and worry goin on for something? You are becoming a procrastinator. You keep thinking about how much you want to run that 5 k race in the spring and finish a champion? Are ya keeping it in mind all the time? Is it something that is defining your ACTIONS and influencing you DECISIONS? If it is, then you're becoming the champion you're dreaming about. Dreaming about it makes it. Think and it shall be. But do not forget that action is thought's son. Thoughts without actions are nothing. Have faith in whatever it is you've steeled your mind to. Have faith and follow through with action.\n\nOk, Ryan that's a bunch of nice words n shit, but how does that help me turn slightly nonzero days into hugely nonzero days. Do you believe all these words you just read? Does it makes sense to you that you BECOME WHAT YOU THINK OF? Ask yourself: What do I think of? When you get home and walk in the door. (how quickly did you turn that laptop on? Did turning it on make you closer to your dreams? What would?) At the bus stop. Lunch break. What direction are you focusing your intentions on? If you're like I was a few years ago, the answer was either No direction, or whatever caught my eye at the moment. But no stress, forgive yourself. You know the truth now. And knowing the truth means you can watch your habits, read books on how you think and act, and finally start changing your behaviour. Heres an example: Feeling like bunk cause you had zero days or barely nonzero days? THINK ABOUT WHAT YOURE DOING. and change just a little bit more. in whatever positive direction you are choosing to go.", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "- Rule number 1: No more zero days, even small actions count\n- Rule number 2: Be grateful to past, present, and future versions of yourself\n- Rule number 3: Forgive yourself for past mistakes and focus on being better in the future\n- Rule number 4: Exercise and read books for self-improvement\n- Becoming what you think, the power of positive thinking and action"}
{"question": "I want you to act like a complete expert in the field of web components and accessibility. I'm going to post you a series of highlights from the Full Stack Web Components book about custom elements and form controls. Please summarize each item and repeat it back to me in terms I can understand better:\n\n - “By default, the HTMLInputElement should report validity and it’s value to a parent HTMLFormElement, however, the Shadow DOM boundary blocks communication between the form and input” - “When form inputs are not properly configured, accessibility issues can also arise because screen readers expect form controls to have specific relationships with elements that label them. Shadow DOM can break the connection between a label and form control. - Form-associated custom elements solve these problems by introducing the ElementInternals interface on the custom element. The ElementInternals interface allows the custom element to participate in a form like any typical form control.” - “When the formAssociated property is set to true on the custom element class, ElementInternals is provided to an autonomous custom element by calling attachInternals(). It’s typical to set another property on the class to an instance of ElementInternals so you can reference it later” - “What sets form-associated custom elements apart from autonomous custom elements is the addition of the ElementInternals interface and a new property named formAssociated. When formAssociated is true, the custom element provides a slew of other lifecycle hooks” - “If TextInputComponent extended from the HTMLInputElement class, it would be a customized built-in element and lose the ability to incorporate Shadow DOM or become a form-associated custom element.” - “appears the structure of the template is just enough to support the input and validation messages, but lacks support for the label. This is intentional because the label must be a sibling of TextInputComponent, not a child, so screen readers can effectively analyze the form for accessibility purposes” - “ElementInternals gives a form control the ability to communicate value and validity with the form.” - “The third property called condition is equal to a function that takes an element as an argument and returns a boolean. We should assume the element passed into the first argument is the form control we’re validating against.” - “treat the HTMLInputElement as the single source of truth for component state and essentially use TextInputComponent as a pass-thru, exposing properties of the HTMLInputElement with getters on the component class and using setters that change the state of the HTMLInputElement. That way, TextInputComponent exposes an outward-facing API” - “value and disabled can reliably be set through properties on HTMLInputElement, but there is no equivalent setter for required; required state must be set through an attribute” - “It’s likely the HTMLInputElement hasn’t received a call to setAttribute because it doesn’t exist yet. Remember, the HTMLInputElement is encapsulated by Shadow DOM. When TextInputComponent instantiates, attributeChangedCallback fires almost immediately, but the browser hasn’t yet fully parsed all the nodes in the ShadowDOM. - To handle situations like this, custom elements include another lifecycle method named connectedCallback that runs when the custom element is added to DOM. connectedCallback offers a space where you can reliably query DOM nodes in the custom element ShadowRoot.” - “Combined with attributeChangedCallback, you developed a means to pass the values of attributes from parent to child whenever the custom element is instantiated, while getters and setters declared on the TextInputComponent class handle changing the value whenever it changes during the lifespan of the component” - “list is only a getter on HTMLInputElement. The only way to set list is via setAttribute, which is handled in attributeChangedCallback.” - -", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "1.

{"question": "Summarize the text regarding joint tenancy:\n JOINT, COMMON, OR COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP\nJoint, common, or community ownership or co-ownership means simultaneous ownership of a\ngiven piece of property by several persons (two or more).4 The types of such ownership interests\ninclude the following:\nTenancy in Common\nTenancy in common exists when several (two or more) persons are owners of undivided interests\nin the title to real property. It is created if an instrument conveying an interest in real property to\ntwo or more persons does not specify that the interest is acquired by them in joint tenancy, in\npartnership, or as community property. Some instruments of transfer/deeds of conveyance\nclearly state the intentions of the persons acquiring are to hold title as tenants in common.5 No\nright of survivorship exists for individual tenants when title is held as tenants in common. The\nundivided interest of a deceased tenant in common passes to the beneficiaries (heirs or devisees)\nof the estate subject to probate, pursuant to the last will and testament of the deceased or by\nintestate succession. The heirs or devisees of the deceased simply take the tenant's place among\nthe other owners who continue to hold title to the property as tenants in common.6\nJoint Tenancy\nJoint tenancy exists if two or more persons are joint and equal owners of the same undivided\ninterest in real property. Generally, to establish a joint tenancy a fourfold unity must exist:\ninterest, title, time, and possession. Joint tenants have the same interest, acquired by the same\nconveyance, commencing at the same time, and held by the same possession.7\nThe most important characteristic of a joint tenancy is the right of survivorship that flows from\nthe unity of interest. The words \"with the right of survivorship\" are not necessary for a valid joint\ntenancy deed, although they are often inserted. If one joint tenant dies, the surviving joint tenant\n(or tenants) become(s) the owner(s) of the property to the exclusion of the heirs or devisees of\nthe deceased. Thus, joint tenancy property cannot be disposed of by the last will and testament, is\nnot subject to intestate succession, and typically does not become part of the estate of a joint\ntenant subject to probate.\nCreating A Joint Tenancy\nWith limited exception, California appellate courts have accepted and enforced the common law\nrule that if any one of the four unities — time, title, interest or possession — is lacking, a tenancy\nin common, not a joint tenancy, exists. An exception to the general rule has been more recently\napplied in connection with the time of acquisition of the title to the property. Consultation with\nknowledgeable legal counsel is recommended to answer questions that may be posed by property\nowners regarding the establishment of joint tenancies and the legal, practical, tax, estate\nplanning, and other considerations involved.\n 4 See Civil Code Section 682. 5 See Civil Code Section 685. 6 See Probate Code Section 6400 et seq. 7 See Civil Code Section 683.\nReal Property Ownership and Deed Recording\n4\nHowever, by statute a joint tenancy may be created:8\n1. By transfer from a sole owner to himself or herself and others as joint tenants.\n2. By transfer from tenants in common to themselves or to themselves, or any of them, and\nothers as joint tenants.\n3. By transfer from joint tenants to themselves, or to any of them, or to others as joint\ntenants.\n4. By transfer from a husband and wife (when holding title as community property or\notherwise) to themselves, or to themselves and others, or to one of them and to another or\nothers as joint tenants.\n5. By transfer to executors of an estate or trustees of a trust as joint tenants.", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "Joint, common, or community ownership allows multiple persons to simultaneously own a property, with the type of ownership determining the rights and responsibilities of the co-owners. Tenancy in common does not grant survivorship rights, meaning the undivided interest of a deceased co-owner passes to their heirs. On the other hand, joint tenancy confers the right of survivorship, meaning that the surviving co-owner(s) automatically inherit the deceased co-owner's interest. The four unities required for joint tenancy are interest, title, time, and possession, though California law provides some exceptions to these requirements.

{"question": "EZRA KLEIN: You write in that piece, “It is no exaggeration to say that systems like these pose a real and imminent threat to the fabric of society.” Why? Walk me through what that world could look like.\n\nGARY MARCUS: Let’s say if somebody wants to make up misinformation about Covid. You can take a system like Galactica, which is similar to ChatGPT, or you can take GPT-3. ChatGPT itself probably won’t let you do this. And you say to it, make up some misinformation about Covid and vaccines. And it will write a whole story for you, including sentences like, “A study in JAMA” — that’s one of the leading medical journals — “found that only 2 percent of people who took the vaccines were helped by it.”\n\nYou have a news story that looks like, for all intents and purposes, like it was written by a human being. It’ll have all the style and form and so forth, making up its sources and making up the data. And humans might catch one of these, but what if there are 10 of these or 100 of these or 1,000 or 10,000 of these? Then it becomes very difficult to monitor them.\n\nWe might be able to build new kinds of A.I., and I’m personally interested in doing that, to try to detect them. But we have no existing technology that really protects us from the onslaught, the incredible tidal wave of potential misinformation like this.\n\nAnd I’ve been having this argument with Yann LeCun, who’s the chief A.I. scientist at Meta, and he’s saying, well, this isn’t really a problem. But already we’ve seen that this kind of thing is a problem. So it was something that really blew my mind around Dec. 4. This was right after ChatGPT came out. People used ChatGPT to make up answers to programming questions in the style of a website called Stack Overflow.\n\nNow everybody in the programming field uses Stack Overflow all the time. It’s like a cherished resource for everybody. It’s a place to swap information. And so many people put fake answers on this thing where it’s humans ask questions, humans give answers, that Stack Overflow had to ban people putting computer-generated answers there. It was literally existential for that website. If enough people put answers that seemed plausible but we’re not actually true, no one would go to the website anymore.\n\nAnd imagine that on a much bigger scale, the scale where you can’t trust anything on Twitter or anything on Facebook or anything that you get from a web search because you don’t know which parts are true and which parts are not. And there’s a lot of talk about using ChatGPT and its ilk to do web searches. And it’s true that some of the time. It’s super fantastic. You come back with a paragraph rather than 10 websites, and that’s great.\n\nBut the trouble is the paragraph might be wrong. So it might, for example, have medical information that’s dangerous. And there might be lawsuits around this kind of thing. So unless we come up with some kinds of social policies and some technical solutions, I think we wind up very fast in a world where we just don’t know what to trust anymore. I think that’s already been a problem for society over the last, let’s say, decade. And I think it’s just going to get worse and worse.\nSummarize this dialogue", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "Ezra Klein and Gary Marcus discuss the potential threats of advanced AI systems like ChatGPT to society.

{"question": "Summarize the following email and tell me all the most important points:\n\nHakeem, Alan and Steven -\n\nHere's a little background for y'all (having just come from California, I had to use that 😂)...\n\nShad and I met with Peter Bloom in La Jolla (San Diego) last week. Pete has been involved in a number of various energy projects over the years and he and I share an interest in antique heavy equipment (this is where I met him). After our meeting, Pete summarized our discussions - see his email below. I'm sharing this with you because in a way, Pete's email forms the skeleton of a business plan for R&R. He captured the main topics we discussed but we need to separate those major topics into their own \"stand alone\" business plans. \n\nFor now considering your present assignment, let's focus on utility work in the USA only. We can look at the other items later on. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, Alan and I developed a budget identifying the \"cost of doing business\" should we move to Texas or California. This summarizes the expenditures we'd expect such as personnel salaries, office rental, vehicles, etc. We did a three year forecast of these costs to see how much money we would need to operate a company down in the USA. This was a rather \"crude\" estimate in that all we did was multiply the rate or cost of an item by the number of units or hours. With respect to the number of hours that a person would contribute, we simply assumed two categories. One is where a person would have full time involvement and therefore would consume 2,080 hours, which is considered to be standard work year (40 hours a week x 52 weeks a year). The other is where they would have part-time involvement and in this case, we assumed they would only work half a year or 1,040 hours. Given more time, we need to refine this estimate a bit more. The main purpose of this budget was to seek financial assistance in the form of a business loan so we were \"conservative\" in our numbers in this estimate. In reality, our actual costs would likely be less but for the purposes of this budget (where we were seeking as much money as we could get), we went slightly overboard with our numbers.\n\nKnowing our costs, we now need to figure out how much revenue we could earn. How we earn revenue is by undertaking projects. So, what I asked Steven to do initially was some desktop research to identify potential projects in the Texas market that we'd be qualified to bid on - specifically, high voltage transmission line work. These could be found by searching various local utility websites. I think there are maybe six major utilities in Texas - like AEP Texas, CenterPoint Energy, Oncor Electric, Texas - New Mexico Power, etc. Projects should be listed on these (or similar) websites along with other information such as schedule (when they are expected to be built), estimated value, etc. After you collect this information, we'll then summarize it on a spreadsheet and assess the value of what we expect our portion of this work would be.\n\nAfter you gather all this information on the spreadsheet, we'll have what we need to complete our business plan and answer the questions Pete asks in his email. And from your research, we'll assume that we earn $X million in revenue per year less $Y million in expenses and the balance should be a positive number that represents our profit.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nFor now, just see what you can do by identifying potential clients (utility companies) in Texas, their project list, the value of these projects and when they're expected to be built. With the information you provide, I'll do a draft of our business plan and share it with you so you can see how your work contributed to our plan.\n\nBest of luck and if you have any questions, please ask.\n\nAll the best!\n\nBill", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "- Bill met with Peter Bloom in La Jolla, who summarized their discussions in an email that forms the skeleton of a business plan for R&R.\n- They need to separate major topics discussed into their own \"stand alone\" business plans.\n- They should focus on utility work in the USA for now, specifically in Texas.\n- Alan and Bill developed a budget identifying the \"cost of doing business\" in Texas or California.\n- They need to refine the budget estimate and seek financial assistance in the form of a business loan.\n- Steven was asked to identify potential high voltage transmission line projects in Texas that they could bid on.\n- The information gathered will be summarized on a spreadsheet to assess the value of potential work.\n- Once all information is gathered, they can complete their business plan and address questions from Pete's email.\n- The goal is to earn revenue that exceeds expenses to generate profit."}

These emotions are often tied to our ancestral and family dynamics, which can create a sense of being \"triggered\" and reactive in our current relationships. \n\nThe Buddhist principles of the \"five poisons\" - greed, hatred, delusion, pride, and envy - are particularly relevant here. These destructive energies can easily infiltrate our interactions, leading to misunderstandings, projection, and the feeling that our partner is judging or blaming us, even when that may not be their intent.\n\nAdditionally, the notes mention the important role of the vagus nerve and nervous system sensitivity. When there is a lot of anxiety and unresolved trauma in one's family history, the vagus nerve can become easily dysregulated, causing us to perceive neutral situations as threatening. This can contribute to the quick escalation of conflicts.\n\nThe key is to have the privilege and self-awareness to pause, introspect, and tend to these deep-seated issues, rather than simply reacting. Practices like chanting, breathing, yoga, and conscious inquiry can help calm the nervous system and create space to understand the root causes of the anger. Approaching these challenges together, with patience and compassion, can strengthen the relationship and allow you both to navigate the old hurts with more clarity and care."}
{"question": "Please summarize the following:\n\nThere was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was an upright man of integrity; he feared God and shunned what was bad. Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. His livestock amounted to 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 cattle, and 500 donkeys, along with a very large number of servants, so that he became the greatest of all the people of the East.\nEach of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day. They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. After a series of banquet days was complete, Job would send for them in order to sanctify them. Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them. For Job said: “Maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.” That is what Job would always do.\nNow the day came when the sons of the true God\\*f entered to take their station before Jehovah,g and Satanh also entered among them.\nThen Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.” And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of\\* my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.” At that Satan answered Jehovah: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have you not put up a protective hedge around himm and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands,n and his livestock has spread out in the land. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence\\* of Jehovah.\nNow on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,p 14 a messenger came to Job and said: “The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them 15 when the Sa·beʹans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword.

I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n20 At that Job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head; then he fell to the ground and bowed down 21 and said:\n“Naked I came out of my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked I will return.r\nJehovah has given,s and Jehovah has taken away.\nLet the name of Jehovah continue to be praised.”\n22 In all of this, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong.\\*", "subject": "text_summarization", "answer": "Job was a wealthy and righteous man in the land of Uz, with seven sons, three daughters, and a large number of livestock and servants.
