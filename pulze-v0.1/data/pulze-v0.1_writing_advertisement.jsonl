{"question": "you will write a youtube ad script. here is some information: I’ve thought of this idea because after college, meeting people is 10x as difficult. Instead of an app, a way to test this could be YouTube ads to people in early 20s living in Minneapolis that say if they wanna meet people they can give phone number / email or sign up on a link where they give a bit of info on themselves / interests / photo / contact info (can be a google form that goes to a google sheets database. Then, we charge people say $50-100 for access to the info on people that wanna meet people. So flow is: ad, landing page with free version (so they don’t get to fill form till paying for full version and can understand how / why etc it works, we can say we make ppl pay so you don’t waste time with people who aren’t serious/ responsive), then they can click link to pay, payment screen, then link to full version. All the work is on other people to reach out, which is good cause then it feels more natural. Plus, if people get upset we charge $ then that’s fine, most will understand it costs $ to get people to join it because of ads.", "subject": "writing_advertisement", "answer": "[Opening shot of a group of friends laughing and having a great time]\n\nNarrator: Are you tired of swiping through endless profiles on dating apps, only to never actually meet anyone in person?\n\n[Cut to a shot of someone scrolling through a dating app looking frustrated]\n\nNarrator: Well, we have a solution for you!

{"question": "You are a Story Brand marketing expert, creating Facebook ad copy for the following lead magnet, which should include the Primary Text, Headline, and Description :\n\nTITLE: \n\nSoul Spark Healing & Guidance\nVALUES ASSESSMENT\nJill Jablonski, Certified Spiritual Life Coach\n\nBODY:\nHELLO BEAUTIFUL SOUL!!\nI’M SO HAPPY THAT YOU FOUND YOUR WAY HERE!\n \nHave you ever asked yourself - Why does it seem so easy for some people to get what they want, and to have the life and relationships they desire? And then for others, it seems so difficult, challenging, and even painful? Sometimes it feels like as soon as you start to get ahead, something else happens that demands your attention.\n And there it is, right there….ATTENTION.\nYour attention is a valuable commodity and people will do almost anything for your attention. Think about how much money is spent in advertising every year. If some- one can control what you are paying attention to, then it’s easier to control you and the direction of your life.\n \nSo what are you paying the most attention to in your life? What are you focused on day in and day out? Are they things and people that matter to YOU personally or are they things/people that you’ve been told “this is what you need to focus on or pay attention to”?\nEven if you’re not sure what exactly the answers are, determining your values is the first step to making sure your attention and focus is going to the things and the people that are important to you. This is the first step to building a life that feels fulfilling! You’ll feel more joyful and your relationships will be stronger and foundation- ally solid.\nLet’s get started!!\n \n \nSTEP 1\nI would strongly encourage you to set aside at least 30 minutes of undisturbed alone time to complete this exercise. (Make sure the kids and pets are taken care of ahead of time and the Do Not Disturb sign is hung!) Sit somewhere comfortable (but not so comfy you’ll fall asleep!). If you have a meditation or journaling space, that’s perfect.\nPro-tip: Make this a really sacred time for you – light some candles and incense, play some soft music – and set the intention to go inward, connecting with your Higher Self. This is really important.\n\nSTEP 2\nThe Lists – There are 3 lists starting on page 4 of this document: one for Life Values, one for Spiritual Values, and one for Relationship Values. Go through each list and rate each value from 1 – 5 (1 is least important to\nyou and 5 is most important to you). Try to be really discerning with your ratings because at the end of each list, you will be asked to determine your Top 5 from each section (Life, Spiritual, and Relationship). P.S. – There are blank lines for you to write in anything that’s important to you that’s not already included on the list.\nPro-tip: Go through each of the lists a couple of times if you need to in order to whittle it down to JUST 5 that are MOST important to YOU (not what anyone else thinks you should say). If you really get stuck, try discerning which values you have rated as 5’s that you could give a 4.5, and then count those 4.5’s as 4’s. And of course it’s okay to take a break and come back to the exercise with fresh eyes.\n\nSTEP 3\nYou should now have a Top 5 Values for each Life, Spiritual, and Relationship, totaling 15. Post these three Top 5 lists in a prominent place – perhaps the inside cover of your journal, on sticky notes on your bathroom mirror, or take a picture of them with your phone and make it your wallpaper – somewhere easily accessible to you where you will see them all the time.\nSo you know your most important values….Now what???\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nUse this list to evaluate where in your life you can make better choices about what you are spending your time, attention, and focus on.\nDecide what needs to change ahead of time: for example, maybe you have determined that family time is more important to you than being accessible at all hours of the day to your company. Perhaps you decide, based on your values, to make a rule for yourself – no work after 7pm. You now stash your phone/laptop at 7pm sharp and designate your evenings for family time. Imagine how much happier you will be and stronger your relationships can be just based on that simple change stemming from making decisions based on your most important values!\n\nOr perhaps you’ve determined that you really value your Sundays for alone time for the fact that it allows you to start the week feeling refreshed and prepared. If you’re truly making decisions based on your values, when someone asks you to do something social on a Sunday, your answer is that you’re not available that day – no matter how badly\nyou don’t want to “hurt their feelings” – you’re not available that day. If it is something you’d like to do, you can offer another day that works for you, but on Sundays, YOU ARE NOT AVAILABLE. PERIOD.\n\nMaking choices and focusing your attention based on your values is one of the most important steps you can take towards a happy, fulfilling, self-directed life – a life\nwhere you feel like you’re in control of your time and not at the mercy of everyone\nelse. Maintaining firm boundaries around this is one of the most important acts of self- love and the bonus is that you become a model of self-love for all those around you!\n[Values checklists go here for SPIRITUAL VALUES, RELATIONSHIP VALUES, and LIFE VALUES]\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nAs we grow and evolve throughout our lives, it’s perfectly natural that our values will evolve as well. It’s good to periodically pull this exercise out and re-evaluate your values to see if ad- justments to your life need to be made.

We Have Curated A Guide To Help You Welcome Your New Pet.\n\nLanding page Text\n\n \"Adopting a new puppy or dog can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but what can you expect from the entire process? There are so many dogs in animal shelters all over the world looking for their forever homes, including both puppies and older dogs. These adorable dogs may have come to a rescue centre because they've had a rough start to life or their previous owners may no longer have been able to care for them. One thing's for sure though, rescue dogs just need someone who can offer them plenty of love and understanding. If you think you could offer a rescue dog or puppy a warm and happy home, keep reading and we'll answer all your questions, including how to adopt a dog and where to find a rescue centre. Adopting a dog Giving a rescue dog a happy new home can be a rewarding experience for you and a transformation for dog that's waiting for a second chance, but there's a lot to consider and prepare for when adopting a rescue dog. Should I adopt a dog or a puppy? Adopting a dog or puppy from a rescue centre can be an incredibly rewarding experience. Not only will you be supporting the work of a worthwhile charity, but you'll also be giving an unwanted pup a second chance. If you're thinking about adopting a dog, you'll need to decide whether you have time for a bouncy puppy or want to get a calmer, older dog instead. Puppies will demand a lot of devotion such as training, cleaning up, disciplining and will require plenty of attention to give them everything they need. Because of this, it's not a good idea to consider a puppy if you work long hours or if there won't be someone around during the day to care for them. On the other hand, if you adopt an older dog, they will already have an established routine, a degree of training and will generally just be more responsible. Finding a friend for life If you're unsure what kind of dog best suits your lifestyle, home and family, your local dog adoption centre can help with that. When you express an interest in rescuing a dog or puppy, the dog rescue will usually give you a questionnaire to fill out to better understand your current circumstances, then they'll be able to recommend a suitable dog for you. They're well versed in finding good matches for both people and pets, so you can rest assured that they can help in finding you a friend for life. Additionally, leading charities can offer you lifelong support, so if you ever have issues with your dog, most rescue centres will be willing to help. If your circumstances ever change, most will welcome their dogs back again too. Things to consider when adopting a dog: Making the decision to get a new dog is always exciting, but there are many considerations you should also take into account. In some sad circumstances, dogs end up in rehoming centres because of neglect or maltreatment. Some may come with a bit of baggage, but staff will always be honest about a dog's needs: be sure you can handle the commitment if you're adopting a dog with a hard history. If you live in rented accommodation, be sure to check with your landlord that you can have a dog at the property beforehand. If you already have dogs, introducing a rescue animal should be done with care. If a dog has been used for breeding or showing, they may have learned certain behaviours that you'll have to help them adapt. It can take time and effort to settle a rescue dog into your home and build a bond, so be patient. Dogs need plenty of space inside and out. Ensure you have enough room in your living arrangements before rescuing a dog. You'll also need enough space in your schedule. Dogs require daily walks and interaction: be sure you have enough time to dedicate to their behavioural, social, and physical needs. There are cost implications of adopting a dog; as well as adoption fees, which vary among rehoming centres, you also need to think about the long-term cost implications of having a puppy. Account for pet insurance, potential vet bills and routine treatments, food, grooming, accessories, toys and kennel bills for when you're on holiday. Dog Breeds: At adoption centres, there's a huge variety of dog breeds available, from West Highland Terriers to Husky's, you never know what you're going to get! There does tend to be a lot of more mixed breeds. However, just because a pup doesn't have a pure bloodline, doesn't make them any less of a worthy companion! How to adopt a dog When considering how to adopt a dog, the first thing you need to do is to find a dog adoption centre, there are hundreds of options which can be found online or locally. It's a good idea to find one that's relatively local to you as some centres will require you to go for multiple visits to ensure that you're a good match with your chosen pup. Once you've found your perfect puppy, you'll need to complete an application form which will include information about you, your family and your living circumstances, this will help for them to assess if the dog will match you. After this, you can expect a phone call or email from the adoption centre where they'll set up an appointment for you to finally meet your potential pup. Once you get there, you'll be able to meet and interact with them and usually, you'll also be able to visit and interact with a variety of other dogs to ensure that your choice is the right one. One thing to be aware of is that some centres like to make a home visit before you officially rescue a dog to ensure it is a suitable environment. If you already have pets, they may also want to see if the dog gets on with them. Find out more about rehoming centres in your area via Dog's Trust, The Blue Cross, The RSPCA in England and Scotland, Battersea Dogs' and Cats' Home, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The first encounter We're all guilty of letting our heart lead our head, you may see a cute little ball of fluff at your local rescue centre and fall instantly in love, but when you get home you might discover that your personalities are not compatible. Due to this, when you first meet your potential pup, you should go with a list of questions to ask the staff. The following questions are a good starting point: Was the dog appropriately socialised as a puppy? How old are they? Do they have any special needs I need to be aware of? How long have they been at the rescue centre? Do you have any information on their life before the centre? What extent of training have they had? These questions are just a starting point, but prior to your visit you should sit down and compile a list of all the things you need to know. Also, think of any desirable/undesirable qualities for a dog, as this will ensure that the match between your and your adopted dog is right first time will reduce the risk of them having to be returned. Does it cost money to adopt a dog? Most dog adoption centres require an adoption fee, which varies between centres. Usually it will help towards the cost of your dog's stay at the rescue centre and the small fee will ensure that they can continue to help other animals. The initial adoption fee will also usually cover your dog's vaccinations, their spay or neutering procedure - if they're old enough - as well as a full vet check-up. How do I rescue a stray dog? Before rescuing a stray dog, you should firstly ensure that it is homeless. Ask people in the area if they recognise the dog and post online to see if it's lost. You should also visit a vet to see if the dog has a microchip. Once you've determined the dog is definitely homeless, take it to a vet for a full check-up and a microchip for before settling them into your home. How long does the process of rescuing a dog take? The process varies between cases. If you're adopting a scared or nervous dog with a difficult past, you'll need to visit the centre several times to allow them to get used to you. It'll also depend on if the centre requires a home check to take place too, as this will lengthen the process. That's our guide on how to adopt a dog!
