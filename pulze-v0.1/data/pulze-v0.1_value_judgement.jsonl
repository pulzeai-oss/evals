{"question": "Write an academic essay that directly addresses the prompt with a clear central idea, supported by evidence, reasoning, and scholarship. Use at least one example, and write for a well-informed audience. Demonstrate skillful cohesion and paragraphing using a wide range of vocabulary, structures, and language. The essay question is:\n\nThe person you are the most afraid to contradict is yourself. \n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?", "subject": "value_judgement", "answer": "The fear of contradicting oneself is a common human experience that arises from the complexity of our own thoughts and beliefs. While some may argue that this fear is a sign of self-awareness and integrity, others may see it as a hindrance to personal growth and intellectual development. In this essay, I will explore the extent to which I agree with the statement that the person you are most afraid to contradict is yourself.\n\nOne reason why individuals may fear contradicting themselves is the desire to maintain a sense of consistency and coherence in their beliefs and values. Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that humans have a natural inclination to seek harmony between their thoughts, feelings, and actions. When faced with conflicting ideas or beliefs, individuals may experience discomfort and anxiety, leading them to avoid situations that challenge their existing beliefs. This fear of cognitive dissonance can manifest as a reluctance to question or challenge one's own beliefs, even when presented with evidence to the contrary.\n\nFor example, consider a person who has held a strong belief in a particular political ideology for many years. When confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs, such as a new study or expert opinion, they may experience cognitive dissonance and feel a sense of fear or discomfort. In this scenario, the person may be more inclined to dismiss or ignore the conflicting information rather than engage with it critically and reconsider their beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, it can be argued that the fear of contradicting oneself can be a barrier to personal growth and intellectual development. Embracing self-contradiction and being open to changing one's beliefs can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and the world around them. By engaging in self-reflection and critical thinking, individuals can challenge their own assumptions and biases, leading to personal growth and intellectual maturity.\n\nMoreover, the fear of contradicting oneself can also limit one's ability to engage in meaningful dialogue and debate with others. In order to engage in productive discussions and learn from different perspectives, individuals must be willing to challenge their own beliefs and be open to considering alternative viewpoints. By overcoming the fear of contradicting oneself, individuals can foster a more inclusive and diverse intellectual environment, where ideas are freely exchanged and debated.\n\nIn conclusion, while the fear of contradicting oneself may stem from a desire for consistency and coherence in one's beliefs, it can also act as a barrier to personal growth and intellectual development. By being open to self-contradiction and embracing the discomfort that comes with challenging one's own beliefs, individuals can deepen their understanding of themselves and the world around them. Ultimately, the ability to engage in critical self-reflection and be open to changing one's beliefs is essential for personal growth and intellectual maturity."}

{"question": "Hi. How are you? I was wondering, what is more beneficial in Berlin to combat the current climate catastrophe: Starting to plant trees or focusing on photo voltaic?", "subject": "value_judgement", "answer": "Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. \n\nBoth planting trees and installing photovoltaic panels are important actions to combat the current climate crisis. However, in the context of Berlin, it might be more beneficial to focus on planting trees. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide, providing shade and cooling effects, improving air quality, and supporting biodiversity. \n\nBerlin has already made significant progress in expanding green spaces and increasing tree cover, but there is always room for more. Planting trees can help mitigate the effects of urban heat islands, reduce energy consumption for cooling, and enhance the overall quality of life in the city.\n\nThat being said, investing in solar energy through photovoltaic panels is also a valuable and effective way to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. It ultimately depends on the specific needs and resources of the city, but a combination of both tree planting and solar energy initiatives would be ideal for combating the climate crisis in Berlin."}

Pipelines to fine-tune different state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation models\nPipelines to find optimal parameters for different image processing techniques (like HSV range for color detection and different contour analysis techniques to filter the noise).\n\nProjects \nGolf Swing/Pose Analysis\nI had fine-tuned Yolov7 to detect different Golf ClubHeads and utilized spline interpolation to find the ClubHead locations in the missing (false positives) frames and utilized the Mediapipe’s Pose Estimation to detect the swing start and end and analyzed the swing trail and pose of the player during the swing.\nSwimmers Race Analysis System\nWe didn’t have the data set required to train a Swimmer Detector so I completed this project utilizing Image Processing techniques, I utilized the color detection to find the pool coordinates i.e., finish line, top, left, right boundaries coordinates and the lanes coordinates dividing each swimmer area in the pool and then combined the color detection with the motion detection technique to detect the swimmers and display the start and finish time of each swimmer.\nPen Rotation Detection\nI had fine-tuned the Yolov5 Oriented Bounding Box detector on a data set of different pens provided by the client and then made a post-processing pipeline to find the current angle of the pen from the predicted oriented bounding box. I had to write this post-processing pipeline instead of training an end-to-end system as there were multiple different pens in the data set and I knew that the model will not be able to differentiate the head from the tail for all the pens accurately as many pens had similar head and tails and we had only around 300 images.\nSmart Text Overlay on TikTok Videos\nThe requirement of the client was to overlay the given text on a video ignoring the person’s face/body and TikTok application control panel and the video description area. I utilized the Mediapipe Person Segmentation technique to get the maximum area where the text can be placed ignoring the whole body and if that area was too small I moved to only ignoring the face area for that video utilizing the Mediapipe’s Face Detection and then find the font size (maximum possible), font color (with contrast to the background) and overlayed the text. I also up-sold this client by adding 10+ text/scene transitions and 10+ text animation effects utilizing image processing techniques.\nSubtitles Extraction Application\n\nThe client’s requirement was to generate the .srt subtitles files given a video. So I utilized the Easy OCR for this project to get the text at each frame and to speed up this whole process I created a mask image for the text at each frame and only run the OCR when the text mask is changed in the video\ni.e. when the new subtitle is displayed.\nVehicle Speed Detection\nIn this project, I utilized the pre-trained Yolov7 model with the Deep Sort Tracker to detect and track the vehicles in the video and utilized the distance covered and the time taken by each vehicle to find their average speeds. I converted the distance from the pixels to meters utilizing an approximate formula shared by the client.\nVideo Game Analysis System\nIn this project, I utilized the feature matching technique to detect the start and end screen of the game and utilized the Pytesseract OCR to get the players’ and characters’ names and utilized contour detection to get count of each player’s lives left and store the winner name, game start/end time along with the time at which each player lost a life.\nFace Spoofing Detection\nIn this project, I utilized the Mediapipe’s Face Landmarks Detector to detect different facial expressions requested by the machine for the user to make, in order to differentiate whether the person is real or fake (image/video).\nReal Time Hand Gesture Recognition\nIn this project, I trained a Support Vector Machine on top of the Mediapipe’s Hands Landmarks to recognize A-Z hand signs on videos in real-time.\nOthers\nSocial Distancing Checker, Snap Chat Filter Triggered based on Facial Expressions, Harry Potter Invisibility Cloak, Virtual Paint Application Controlled by Hand Gestures, Controlling video games with facial expressions and body movements, Generating a complete Dataset from one image using Saliency Detection and Data Augmentation.\nSkills \nManagement Team Management, Critical Thinking, Active listening, Problem Solving, Coaching and\nLanguages Python, JavaScript\nFrameworks OpenCV, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, Sci‑kit Learn, React.js, React Native\nEducation \nCOMSATS University Islamabad Islamabad, Pakistan\nBACHELORS OF SCiENCE iN SOFTWARE ENGiNEERiNG Mar 2017 ‑ Aug 2021\nCourses: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Databases, Data Structures.\nSuccessfully attained 60% academic scholarship for maintaining high merit in all semesters.\nSecured 3.34 CGPA.\nCoursera Online\nAI ONLiNE SPECiALiZATiONS Mar 2020 ‑ Current\nDeep Learning Specialization.\nDeep Learning.AI Tensorflow Developer Specialization.\nNatural Language Processing Specialization (Not Completed yet).\nSteps College Rawalpindi, Pakistan\nINTERMEDiATE iN COMPUTER SCiENCE Mar 2015 ‑ Mar 2017\nSecured 7th position in Punjab Board in Intermediate Part-1.\n\"", "subject": "value_judgement", "answer": "Based on the resume, the candidate appears to be a strong fit for the role of a machine learning engineer.

{"question": "Critically analyze the argument that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are vital for ensuring global food security. Express your nuanced perspective on the subject, considering scientific, environmental, and social aspects.", "subject": "value_judgement", "answer": "The argument that GMOs are vital for ensuring global food security is a complex and controversial issue that requires a nuanced perspective. While GMOs have the potential to increase crop yields, improve nutritional content, and enhance resistance to pests and diseases, there are also significant concerns regarding their impact on human health, the environment, and social equity.\n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of GMOs is their ability to increase crop yields, which is seen as essential for feeding the growing global population. By incorporating traits that improve resistance to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses, GMOs have the potential to produce higher yields and ensure a more stable food supply. In regions with limited access to arable land or where climate change is causing more frequent crop failures, GMOs could play a crucial role in ensuring food security.\n\nHowever, there are also concerns about the long-term impact of GMOs on human health and the environment. Critics argue that not enough research has been done to fully understand the potential risks of consuming GMOs, including the potential for allergenic reactions or the development of antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the widespread use of GMOs could lead to a loss of biodiversity and harm beneficial insects and other organisms in the ecosystem.\n\nFrom a social perspective, the adoption of GMOs has also raised concerns about the concentration of power and control in the hands of a few multinational corporations. The patenting of genetically modified seeds and the requirement for farmers to purchase new seeds every year can lead to increased costs for small-scale farmers and further marginalize already vulnerable populations. Furthermore, there are concerns about the impact of GMOs on traditional farming practices and the cultural heritage of farming communities.\n\nIn conclusion, while GMOs have the potential to contribute to global food security, it is important to consider the potential risks and unintended consequences associated with their widespread adoption. A more holistic approach to food security that considers agroecological practices, biodiversity conservation, and social equity may offer a more sustainable and resilient solution in the long run. It is crucial to continue researching and monitoring the impact of GMOs on human health, the environment, and society, and to involve all stakeholders in the decision-making process to ensure a more inclusive and ethical approach to food production."}
