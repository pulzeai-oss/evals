{"question": "For the provided research paper, extract important findings and statistics concerning climate change impacts.\n\nTitle: Climate Change: Examining Current Impacts and Urgent Mitigation Strategies\n\nAbstract:\nThis scientific paper provides an updated assessment of climate change, incorporating new statistics on its impacts and driving forces. The research highlights the escalating consequences of global warming, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. Utilizing the latest data, the paper underscores the urgent need for comprehensive mitigation strategies, such as renewable energy adoption, afforestation, sustainable agriculture, and energy efficiency measures, to avert the worst effects of climate change.\n\nIntroduction\nClimate change remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with dire implications for the planet and its inhabitants. This paper aims to present the latest statistics on climate change impacts and causes while emphasizing the importance of immediate and effective mitigation measures.\n\nImpacts of Climate Change: New Statistics\n2.1. Escalating Sea Levels\nRecent data reveals that global sea levels have risen at an average rate of 3.6 millimeters per year over the past decade, almost double the rate of the previous century. By 2100, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates a sea-level rise of up to 1 meter, which poses an imminent threat to coastal populations and ecosystems.\n\n2.2. Increasing Frequency of Extreme Weather Events\nNew statistics indicate a significant surge in extreme weather events worldwide. Over the past five years, the occurrence of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has increased by 20%, leading to devastating impacts on vulnerable communities and infrastructure.\n\n2.3. Ecosystem Disruptions and Biodiversity Loss\nThe latest assessments indicate that climate change has already contributed to the loss of approximately 1 million species, with many more at risk of extinction. Changing climate patterns are disrupting ecosystems, affecting habitats, migration patterns, and the delicate balance of ecosystems.\n\n2.4. Agricultural Challenges\nRecent data highlights that crop yields have decreased by an average of 5% globally over the last decade due to climate-related factors. This alarming trend threatens food security and livelihoods for millions of people, particularly in regions dependent on agriculture.\n\n2.5. Health Risks Amplification\nNew research suggests that the health impacts of climate change are more severe than previously estimated. An increase in heatwaves and air pollution has resulted in a rise in heat-related illnesses, respiratory diseases, and other climate-sensitive health conditions.\n\nCauses of Climate Change\n3.1. Mounting Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThe latest statistics demonstrate a concerning rise in global greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached a record high of 40.9 billion metric tons in the past year, primarily driven by fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities.\n\nUrgent Mitigation Strategies\n4.1. Rapid Transition to Renewable Energy\nBased on recent advancements in renewable energy technology, transitioning to renewable sources like solar and wind power is critical to reducing GHG emissions and limiting global warming.\n\n4.2. Large-Scale Afforestation and Reforestation\nNew studies emphasize the potential of afforestation and reforestation efforts in sequestering vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Encouraging global tree planting initiatives can play a crucial role in climate change mitigation.\n\n4.3. Sustainable Agricultural Practices\nRecent data confirms that sustainable agricultural practices, such as precision farming, agroforestry, and reduced tillage, not only contribute to reduced emissions but also enhance soil carbon storage, bolstering climate resilience.\n\n4.4. Energy Efficiency and Conservation Measures\nUpdated statistics underscore the significance of energy efficiency measures in curbing emissions. Implementing energy-efficient technologies in buildings, industries, and transportation can substantially reduce energy consumption and associated GHG emissions.\n\nConclusion\nThe latest statistics leave no room for doubt: climate change is an urgent and escalating crisis that requires immediate action. By acknowledging the new data on its impacts and causes, we can better comprehend the magnitude of the problem and focus on science-based mitigation strategies. Through collaborative efforts at the international, national, and individual levels, humanity can forge a sustainable path, safeguarding the planet and future generations from the worst consequences of climate change.", "subject": "information_extraction", "answer": "1.

The war marked a crucial turning point in history as the colonists sought to break free from British rule and establish their own sovereign nation. Tensions had been simmering for years due to various factors, including British taxation policies and perceived lack of representation in Parliament. The conflict ignited with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, and over the next eight years, the Continental Army, led by figures like George Washington, fought against the well-trained and well-equipped British forces. Despite facing numerous challenges and hardships, the colonists' resilience and determination eventually led to their triumph, culminating in the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which officially recognized the United States as an independent nation, ending British colonial rule and setting the stage for the birth of a new country.

{"question": "From the Passage please find out what are the cause of climate change\n\nIn common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.\n\nDue to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.", "subject": "information_extraction", "answer": "According to the passage, the causes of climate change are:\n\n1.
