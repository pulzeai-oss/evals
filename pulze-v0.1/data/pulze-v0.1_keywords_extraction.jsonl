Safra, a French company that specializes in the renovation of passenger transport equipment and a pioneer inhydrogen mobility, presented a hydrogen coach at the recent UITP Summit that took place in Barcelona last week. The hydrogen retrofitted coach features the company’s H2-PACK kit, which has been designed to convert a combustion-powered intercity coach into a zero-emission vehicle.The H2-PACK retrofit kit is fully designed and assembled by Safra. The retrofit kit allows the vehicle’s diesel engine to be transformed into a zero-emission hydrogen-electric powertrain. The original diesel engine is replaced by a 350 kW Dana electric motor that receives power from a100 kW (70 kW useful) Plastic Omniumfuel cell.According to Safra, the H2 used by the hydrogen coach is stored in six tanks, which have been integrated into an area of the vehicle that is separated from the passengers by a watertight, ventilated and secure partition. The tanks allow for 35 kg of hydrogen to be carried on board, delivering a maximum range of 500 km.The hydrogen coach presented at the event belongs to the Occitanie Region.This is France’s second-largest region by surface area, and it has commissioned Safra with retrofitting 15 of its intercity coaches.Hydrogen Coach H2-PACK – D-1 to the opening of the UITP Global Public Transport Summit – Image Credit:SafraThe H2-PACK retrofit offers a number of advantages, but most notably offers economical and ecological benefits. For instance, the cost of converting an existing bus or coach into azero-emission vehicleis much cheaper than buying a brand new vehicle. Additionally, certain on-board components can remain without needing to be reinstalled, such as ticketing equipment, also saving on cost.As for being eco-friendly, the retrofit extends the life of the vehicle, postponing the need for a replacement by several years.

{"question": "Please extract keywords from this: Lessons from the Osprey Garden\nMuch of biologist-naturalist Paul Spitzer’s life has moved in time with the seasonal rhythms of one bird, the osprey, and one place—the “osprey garden.”\n\nIn late spring he paddles his canoe into the Great Island saltmarsh, 500 acres of prime osprey habitat where the Connecticut River flows into Long Island Sound. In this marshy inlet, Spitzer checks for action in nests among 35 osprey platforms that have been erected here since the late 1950s. As he disembarks, the resident ospreys take to anxious flight. He raises a pole topped with a mirror over a platform nest. These days, he sees abundant breeding success in the mirror’s reflection—three healthy young birds with ragged crests and brown-spangled wings. But it wasn’t always this way.\n\nSpitzer first stepped onto Great Island nearly 60 years ago, as an 11-year-old boy in 1957. That year, he accompanied birding legend Roger Tory Peterson on a Christmas Bird Count. Thus began a mentorship that set Spitzer onto a career path to becoming a ecologist.\n\nWhen Spitzer graduated from college, Peterson urged him to take up the question of what was causing a sudden and drastic decline among the ospreys.\n\n“At that time, the curtain was rising on the great DDT drama,” says Spitzer.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1970s, Spitzer watched ospreys almost disappear from Connecticut, and he pioneered experiments that helped establish DDT as a cause of their decline. He has also seen ospreys make a triumphant recovery in the Connecticut River estuary. And with more than 300 active nests recorded in the state today, he is now turning his attention below the water, where the next challenge for osprey is a vanishing fish.\n\nThe Discovery of the Perils of DDT on Osprey Populations\nPeterson tracked the decline of local ospreys from 150 in the 1950s to just 13 in 1965. He and his wife Barbara tried to help the ospreys by building dozens of nest platforms to protect their nests from predators such as raccoons. But the birds still weren’t bringing forth fledglings. Food didn’t seem to be a problem—there was no shortage of menhaden, the large-headed bait fish that is one of the osprey’s primary food sources in Long Island Sound. Spitzer had spent hours watching the fish hawks rising from the water with menhaden nearly a foot long in their oversized talons.\n\n“Roger began to suspect DDT,” Spitzer says. In the 1940s and ‘50s, DDT was used to control mosquito populations in residential areas, especially along coasts and near wetlands. “He had a hunch the ospreys were ingesting the DDT from fish. Rachel Carson’s findings were informing our discouraging field studies, and I was cutting my teeth as an ecologist studying this new paradigm of environmental toxicology.”\n\nDuring nest checks, Spitzer found thin-shelled, collapsing eggs and was re-minded of a British study that showed similar thinning in peregrine falcon eggs.\n\nShortly after receiving his biology degree from Wesleyan University, Spitzer had the idea to isolate local ecological effects in Connecticut by switching eggs in osprey nests there with eggs from a healthy population of breeding osprey near Chesapeake Bay.\n\n“Not nearly as much DDT was applied to Maryland saltmarshes, and it was probably diluted in the far larger Chesapeake system,” says Spitzer. By performing the switch, he could isolate whether the problem was with local environmental conditions or intrinsic to the Connecticut eggs.\n\nThe Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland signed on to Spitzer’s idea and provided staff to collect eggs. From the outset, Spitzer saw the Maryland eggs hatch healthy chicks in Connecticut, but not vice versa.\n\n“The embryos in Connecticut eggs died, and we found the shells to be thin by simple measurement,” he says. “We also found dented or collapsed eggs in some Connecticut nests.” None of these problems affected the Maryland eggs.\n\nNext, he arranged transfers of young nestlings from Maryland to Connecticut, to look beyond egg problems. The results were the same: “Virtually all the Maryland nestlings fledged in Connecticut, [so there were] no problems with food at this time. The failure was egg viability,” Spitzer says. Later lab tests revealed DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) as well as PCBs and another organochloride, dieldrin, at much higher concentrations in the Connecticut eggs compared to the Maryland eggs.\n\n“All signs pointed to Roger’s hunch being right, that it was DDT,” he says.\n\nDDT was banned in Connecticut in 1972, and two years later osprey numbers on Great Island bottomed out, with just a single nest remaining as the vestiges of DDT made their way out of the ecosystem.\n\nToday, there are approximately 100 active nests at Great Island and the overflow is helping populations at nearby Gardiners Island and eastern Long Island grow. Statewide, the Connecticut Audubon Society’s osprey nation monitoring project recorded 337 active nests in 2016, and 490 fledged young throughout the state—a rate nearly double that which Spitzer had calculated was necessary for a stable osprey population.\n\nNumbers like these, along with steady positive trends along Breeding Bird Survey routes, help explain why breeding ospreys are now abundant and widespread in Connecticut and throughout the eastern United States. Spitzer points to a combination of factors including an increase in artificial nest sites, a decrease in harmful residues in their food sources, and continued high levels of food availability, particularly Atlantic menhaden.\n\nOsprey and Menhaden\nFor the last three summers the Connecticut Audubon Society has sponsored Spitzer’s ongoing work in the Connecticut River estuary, but the aim of the research has now shifted to monitoring the relationship between osprey and menhaden. As in the 1960s, Spitzer’s attention is again focused on Great Island, now fittingly protected as a Roger Tory Peterson Wildlife Area. During June and July, Spitzer has documented that the ospreys’ diet is 95 percent to 100 percent menhaden. Spitzer says the story is much the same from Connecticut to Virginia, with menhaden-fueled osprey nesting colonies experiencing a revival.\n\n“Over 50 years of osprey study, we have moved from the sad story of DDT-induced egg failure and a declining population to the happy story of abundant ospreys,” Spitzer says. “Our ongoing legacy from osprey study must be the management of the East Coast ecosystem for abundant menhaden. We have to leave enough menhaden in the water to perform their precious and essential eco- nomic and ecological functions.”\n\nRich in oils and fat, menhaden live in Atlantic coastal waters from Nova Scotia to northern Florida, but reach peak abundance in the Chesapeake Bay. In addition to serving as the primary food source for breeding ospreys and their chicks along the New England coast, menhaden are also a main food source for striped bass and bluefish. And, they constitute a significant fishery for people—second only to pollock among the ranks of fish harvested by volume in the United States. But people don’t eat menhaden for dinner. They process it into other forms, mostly pills.\n\nMost of the nearly 200,000-metric-ton annual menhaden catch is rendered into omega-3 fatty acid fish oil for the health supplement industry. And most of that catch comes via purse-seine fishing, in which two fishing boats circle around a single school of fish and enclose it within a gigantic net. These operations are extremely efficient at catching huge volumes of fish. Only one state (Virginia) currently allows purse-seine fishing of menhaden, but the fish caught in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia waters account for 85 percent of the total menhaden harvest. \n\nBecause a large share of the range-wide menhaden population is clustered in the mid-Atlantic region, harvests there have a significant effect on the population as a whole. As the fish-oil market boomed in the 1990s and 2000s, menhaden populations began to dwindle. In 2010 stocks hit a 54-year low. In 2013 the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission reduced the quota of commercial menhaden harvest by 20 percent. Spitzer attributes the recent robust East Coast osprey populations to the renewed health of the menhaden fishery following these new rules.\n\n“It was a huge win,” says Spitzer.\n\nBut now, many ocean conservationists say menhaden are once again coming under intense fishing pressure. In 2015 and 2016, the quota was increased by about 10 percent, and the menhaden quota for 2017 has been increased by about 6 percent from 2016. Some industry representatives are suggesting that the menhaden quota could be raised by up to 30 percent without harming the overall fishery. Spitzer thinks the ASMFC should be more conservative in what it allows so that the menhaden population doesn’t crash again, as it did earlier this decade. He also thinks the continued abundance of menhaden is critical to the continued abundance of ospreys. \n\n“It is a great blessing to have been able to study ospreys for 50 years and counting. I have observed so many positive outcomes for these birds over the years,” Spitzer says. “Decisions about menhaden now will affect not only fish, but birds, coastal ecosystems and, in the end, every one of us.”", "subject": "keywords_extraction", "answer": "Keywords:\n1.

{"question": "what is the thesis statement of this essay? give me an answer in 2 sentences: Outsider of Tea Culture\nEveryone is acquainted with tea. This is a household name that has a history of thousands of years. Chinese mythology aside, archeological evidence has been found indicating that tea was used as a medicine by the elite as early as the Han dynasty 206 BCE–220 CE which is almost a thousand years ago (Meredith). Being from the generation of my great grandfather, my family also has a long history of sipping tea. Now, with the pace of people's lives getting faster and faster, a kind of \"instant tea\" came into being, like Lay's tea bag on the supermarket shelf. This kind of tea generally has a lot of flavors like lemon or peach flavor. People are gradually forgetting original tea cultures as society moves faster and faster. However, tea culture is a rich and diverse custom that has been practiced for centuries throughout the globe. From the ancient tea ceremonies of China and Japan to the bustling tea houses of India and the Middle East, tea has played a significant role in the social and cultural fabric of numerous societies. However, how many people know the culture or practices behind this familiar product? In other words, although I have been sipping tea for many years, I still regard myself as an outsider of this culture. (THESE STATEMENT)\nBefore we know what tea culture is, we should know what is culture? Raymond Williams calls culture “one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language”. First, culture can be used to refer to ‘a general process of intellectual, spiritual and aesthetic development’. A second use of the word ‘culture’ might be to suggest ‘a particular way of life, whether of a people, a period or a group’. Finally, Williams suggests that culture can be used to refer to ‘the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity’(Williams 90). What is my definition of culture reflection with mine\nUnless you are in the environment mixed with the insider, otherwise definitely do not experience the so-called tea culture. Since it can be considered culture, it must have its spiritual connotation. In recent years, the word \"culture\" has become so prevalent that everything depends on culture. For example, people casually grab some tea at home, know nothing about what is thrown into the glass, and randomly pour boiling water down. Some might just take photos and post it with a prestigious word in social media and some might just swallow bottles of these liquids, and these are so-called \"tea culture\". \nAdmittedly, if we take a broad cultural perspective, we can't deny that this is not culture. When many of us use the word culture, we are outsiders. So what distinguishes us from the insiders and the outsiders, in other words what are the insiders of tea culture? From the characteristics of tea, it must be a few that can really touch the level of [culture]. Overall, the insider perspective of tea culture involves an understanding of the history, traditions, and values that are associated with tea in a particular region or culture, as well as the rituals and practices that have developed around the preparation, serving, and consumption of tea.The key word of “tea culture” in anthropologists’ view of points is “culture”. As Wang Ling writes in her book: “Study of tea culture is not the study of the growth of tea cultivation, production, chemical components, pharmaceutical principles, function of health care, etc. These are the work of natural scientists. Our duty is to study the cultural and social phenomenon in the process of using tea” (Ling 2013). Most people, though they have been drinking tea for decades, are simply a personal habit, far from the word \"insider\". \nI once went to a teahouse and experienced tea culture. Until today, I can still remember how I felt at that time. As soon as you enter the door, you can feel the strong smell of tea. The decoration in the store is elegant, simple and elegant. The clerk greeted me warmly and recommended black tea to me. I sat down and tasted this black tea, felt its mellow flavor, and enjoyed the tea culture and art works in the store. My mood gradually relaxed. The clerk told me that the black tea here comes from Fujian and is made from fresh buds when picking. The taste of tea is mellow and has a natural sweet taste. He also introduced me to the process of tea making and tea tasting methods, which made me have a deeper understanding of tea.\nIn the process of tea tasting, I found that there were also some tea ceremony and tea art performances in the teahouse, and the staff would also carry out some tea ceremony ceremonies with the guests. I was very interested, so I learned some basic tea ceremony rituals from the shop assistant, such as how to serve tea, how to taste tea, and so on. The tea teacher boiled the water in an iron pot, and then made tea in a ceramic pot and funnel. He brewed the tea several times until it unfolded and released its fragrance. I picked up the tea cup and smelled the fragrance of the tea. It exuded a light soil and wood flavor. Then, I took a sip. The taste was very special. It had a strong lingering charm, a little sour, sweet but not greasy, and slightly bitter. The tea soup is very thick and the taste is very smooth. The tea teacher said that this kind of tea can help to reduce fat, reduce fat and digest food. After drinking it, I feel much more comfortable in my stomach. While enjoying the fragrance of tea, I also watched the display of tea sets and tea art. There are various tea sets in the teahouse, including ceramics, silverware, glass and purple clay pots. The tea teacher demonstrated the traditional tea performance, including the technique of pouring tea soup from the pot and the method of tasting tea. In the tea ceremony, I felt a quiet, elegant and introverted beauty, and my mood became more peaceful.\nIn the teahouse, I also made some friends who like tea culture. We shared our love and experience of tea and exchanged our experiences and feelings. This makes me feel very warm, and the tea culture is also richer and more colorful because of this exchange. Not only making and tasting tea, but also communicating on the table is a kind of culture. Because sometimes the purpose of drinking tea is not only to drink, but also to promote communication and communication. From these disparate tea cultures, there are a few common themes that resonate with the tea drinkers of today. For the Chinese, Indians and Brits, tea was a way to bring people together. It was a shared experience and a chance to connect with other people.(Dwyer) Drinking tea can become a medium of communication, and places such as teahouses and teahouses are usually places for people to communicate. The brewing process of tea takes a certain amount of time, which can be used for chat and exchange. In the process of drinking tea, people can share each other's stories, experiences, feelings, or discuss some topics to enhance feelings and exchange ideas. Tea also helps to relieve physical and mental pressure, make people more relaxed and happy, and make it easier to carry out positive dialogue. At the same time, tea culture also brings a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere to people. In the teahouse, people usually maintain a quiet and elegant attitude, do not make noise, do not disturb others, and maintain a respectful attitude, which also helps the smooth communication.\nIn general, this experience of tea culture made me feel the charm and cultural connotation of tea, and made me like tea more. It not only makes me cherish the exchange and sharing between people more. Drinking tea is closely related to communication. Under the influence of tea culture, people can communicate more naturally and comfortably, and also enjoy the calm and harmonious atmosphere brought by tea culture.At the same time, I also deeply feel that as an outsider of tea culture. Although I have had a lot of tea at home since I was young, I have never known the specific technology and process of tea brewing and tasting. I have always thought that I am an insider, so I can be called an outsider.

Für den Fall, dass sich das Bohren nicht umgehen lässt, erfährst du hier, wie es geht. Und falls doch etwas schief läuft und ein Loch misslingt, haben wir einige gute Tipps für dich parat.\n\nInnengestaltungBauenBadWohnen\nInhalt\nDer richtige Bohrer für Fliesen\nVorbereitung – das brauchst du für das Fliesenbohren\nWie bohre ich Fliesen richtig an?\nBohrfehler korrigieren\nAlternativen zum Bohren von Löchern in Fliesen\nDer richtige Bohrer für Fliesen\nFür die Wahl des Bohrers ist die Ritzhärte der Fliese entscheidend. Sie gibt den Grad an, wie stark die keramische Glasur einer Fliese einer ritzenden und kratzenden Beanspruchung standhält. Die Werte werden von 1 (sehr weich) bis 10 (sehr hart) angegeben. Feinsteinzeug erreicht den Härtegrad 8.\n\nZum Bohren von Fliesen bis Ritzhärte 3 verwendest du Fliesen- und Glasbohrer. Bist du geübt und vorsichtig, reicht dir ein Steinbohrer. Noch besser eignen sich aber wassergekühlte Diamantbohrer, die über einen kleinen Wassertank gekühlt werden. Bei härteren Fliesen, zum Beispiel Feinsteinzeug oder modernen Natursteinfliesen, sind diese komplett durchgehärteten Bohrer auf jeden Fall erforderlich.\n\nTipp: Fliesen- und Glasbohrer verwendest du nur zum Durchbohren der Fliese selbst. Für die dahinterliegende Wand wechselst du in jeden Fall zu einem normalen Steinbohrer, da die Spezialbohrer durch das Bohren ins Mauerwerk sehr schnell stumpf werden.\n\nMann bohrt Loch in Fliesenwand\nBohrhammer von Bosch – alle Bohrer im OBI Online-Shop.\n\nFinde eine große Auswahl an Bohrmaschinen im OBI Online-Shop.\nZum Shop\nVorbereitung – das brauchst du für das Fliesenbohren\nBevor du mit dem Bohren beginnst, prüfst du mit einem Messgerät, ob sich hinter dem geplanten Bohrloch Wasser- oder Stromleitungen befinden. Außerdem legst du dein Werkzeug, Klebeband, einen Nagel und gegebenenfalls eine Schale kaltes Wasser zum Kühlen bereit.\n\nDu markierst die Position des Bohrlochs mit einem wasserlöslichen Stift und körnst dann die Lasur der Fliese an dieser Stelle mit einer Anreißnadel oder einem Nagel leicht an. Falls erforderlich, verwendest du einen Hammer, dies allerdings äußerst vorsichtig.\n\nDann klebst du zwei etwa 4 cm breite Streifen transparentes Klebeband kreuzweise über die angekörnte Markierung. So vermeidest du das Splittern des Bohrlochrandes und reduzierst die Abrutschgefahr des Bohrers. Wenn du keinen speziellen wassergekühlten Diamantbohrer verwendest, hältst du eine Schale mit kaltem Wasser zum Kühlen des Bohrers bereit.\n\nHand hält Messgerät an Fliesen\nOrtungsgerät von Bosch – alle Prüf- und Messwerkzeuge im OBI Online-Shop.\n\nWie bohre ich Fliesen richtig an?\nAchte darauf, die Bohrmaschine im rechten Winkel anzusetzen. Wenn der Bohrer verkantet, kann dies zu Absplitterungen führen. Daher empfehlen wir die Verwendung einer Führung.\n\nBei wassergekühlten Bohrern füllst du Wasser in den Tank des Werkzeugs, das bei Drehung des Bohrers an die Bohrstelle geleitet wird. Eine zusätzliche Kühlung des Werkzeugs ist in der Regel nicht nötig, dennoch empfehlen wir dir, bei längerem Bohren – ob bei hoher oder niedriger Drehzahl – die Temperatur sicherheitshalber zu kontrollieren. Bei der Verwendung normaler Glasbohrer und Fliesenbohrer beobachtest du die Temperatur des Bohrers in jedem Fall – und kühlst ihn gegebenenfalls vorsichtig in Wasser.\n\nVor den Bohren schaltest du unbedingt die Schlag- oder Hammerfunktion deiner Bohrmaschine aus. Die beim Bohren mit Schlag entstehenden Erschütterungen würden die Fliese höchstwahrscheinlich beschädigen. Bohre dann mit geringem Druck und niedriger Drehzahl durch die Fliese.\n\nWenn der Bohrer im Mauerwerk angelangt ist, bohrst du wieder mit normalem Druck und üblicher Drehzahl. Falls du in der darunterliegenden Wand ohne Schlag nicht vorwärts kommst, schaltest du die Funktion notfalls wieder ein.\n\nBohrer bohrt Loch in Fliese\nBohrfehler korrigieren\nDas Bohren in Fliesen gehört zu den größeren Herausforderungen für Heimwerker. Fehler können dabei vorkommen. Wenn dir ein Bohrloch missrät, füllst du es am besten mit Spezialspachtel für Fliesen. Überstehende Masse ziehst du mit einem Spachtel nur leicht ab. Nach dem Aushärten glättest du die Oberfläche mit Schleifpapier.

{"question": "Please extract keywords from this: Part 1\nIt was morning, and the new sun sparkled gold across the ripples of a gentle sea. \nA mile from shore a fishing boat chummed the water, and the word for Breakfast Flock flashed through the air, till a crowd of a thousand seagulls came to dodge and fight for bits of food. It was another busy day beginning. \n But way off alone, out by himself beyond boat and shore, Jonathan Livingston Seagull was practicing. A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to hold a painful hard twisted curve through his wings. The curve meant that he would fly slowly, and now he slowed until the wind was a whisper in his face, until the ocean stood still beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath, forced one ... single ... more ... inch ... of ... curve .... Then his feathers ruffled, he stalled and fell. \n Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall. To stall in the air is for them disgraced and it is dishonor. \n But Jonathan Livingston Seagull, unashamed, stretching his wings again in that trembling hard curve - slowing, slowing, and stalling once more - was no ordinary bird. \n Most gulls didn't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight ­how to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, through, it was not eating that mattered, but flight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly. \n This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one's self popular with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting. \n He didn't know why, for instance, but when he flew at altitudes less than half his wingspan above the water, he could stay in the air longer, with less effort. His glides ended not with the usual feet-down splash into the sea, but with a long flat wake as he touched the surface with his feet tightly streamlined against his body. When he began sliding in to feet-up landings on the beach, then pacing the length of his slide in the sand, his parents were very much dismayed indeed. \nWhy, Jon, why?\" his mother asked. \"Why is it so hard to be like the rest of the flock, Jon? Why can't you leave low flying to the pelicans, the albatross? \n\"I don't mind being bone and feathers, Mum. I just want to know what I can do in the air and what I can't, that's all. I just want to know.\" \n\"See here, Jonathan,\" said his father, not unkindly. \"Winter isn't far away. Boats will be few, and the surface fish will be swimming deep. If you must study,. then study food, and how to get it. This flying business is all very well, but you can't eat a glide, you know. Don't you forget that the reason you fly is to eat.\"\n Jonathan nodded obediently. For the next few days he tried to be behave like the other gulls; he really tried, screeching and fighting with the flock around the piers and fishing boats, diving on scraps of fish and bread. But he couldn't make it work. \nIt's all so pointless, he thought, deliberately dropping a hard-won anchovy to a hungry old gull chasing him. I could be spending all this time learning to fly. There's so much to learn! \nIt wasn't long before Jonathan Gull was off by himself again, far out at see, hungry, happy, learning. \n The subject was speed, and in a week's practice he learned more about speed than the fastest gull alive. \n From a thousand feet, flapping his wings as hard as he could, he pushed over into a blazing steep dive toward the waves, and learned why seagulls don't make blazing steep power-dives. In just six seconds he was moving seventy miles per hour, the speed at which one's wing goes unstable on the upstroke. \n Time after time it happened. Careful as he was, working at the very peak of his ability, he lost control at high speed. \n Climb to a thousand feet. Full power straight ahead first, then push over, flapping, to a vertical dive. Then, every time, his left wing stalled on an upstroke, he'd roll violently left, stall his right wing recovering, and flick like fire into a wild tumbling spin to the right. \n He couldn't be careful enough on that upstroke. Ten times he tried, but all ten times, as he passed through seventy miles per hour, he burst into a churning mass of feathers, out of control, crashing down into the water. \n They key, he thought as last, dripping wet, must be to hold the wings still \n From two thousand feet he tried again, rolling into his dive, beak straight down, wings full out and stable from the moment he passed fifty miles per hour. It took tremendous strength, but it worked. In ten seconds he has blurred through ninety miles per hour. Jonathan had set a world speed record for seagulls!\n But victory was short-lived. The instant he began his pullout, the instant he changed the angle of his wings, he snapped into that same terrible uncontrolled disaster, and at ninety miles per hour it hit him like dynamite. Jonathan Seagull exploded in midair and smashed down into a brick-hard sea. \n When he came to, it was well after dark, and he floated in moonlight on the surface of the ocean. His wings were ragged bars of lead, but the weight of failure was even heavier on his back. He wished, feebly, that the weight could be just enough to drag him gently down to the bottom, and end it all. \n As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice sounded within him. There's no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were meant to learn so much about flying, I'd have a falcon's short wings, and live on mice instead of fish. My father was right. I must forget this foolishness. I must fly home to the Flock and be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull. \n The voice faded, and Jonathan agreed. The place for a seagull at night is on shore, and from this moment forth, he vowed, he would be a normal gull. It would make everyone happier. \n He pushed wearily away from the dark water and flew toward the land, grateful for what he had learned about work-saving low-altitude flying. \n But no, he thought. I am done with the way I was, I am done with everything I learned. I am a seagull like every other seagull, and I will fly like one. So he climbed painfully to a hundred feet and flapped his wings harder, pressing for shore. \n He felt better for his decision to be just another one of the flock. there would be no ties now to the force that had driven him to learn, there would be no more challenge and no more failure. And it was pretty, just to stop thinking, and fly through the dark, toward the lights above the beach. \nDark! The hollow voice cracked in alarm. Seagulls never fly in the dark!\n Jonathan was not alert enough to listen. It's pretty, he thought. The moon and the lights twinkling on the water, throwing out little beacon-trails though the \n Get Down! Seagulls never fly in the dark! If you were meant to fly in the dark, you'd have the eyes f an owl! You'd have charts for brains! You'd have a falcon's short wings!\n There in the night, a hundred feet in the air, Jonathan Livingston Seagull ­blinked. His pain, his resolutions, vanished. \n Short Wings. A falcon's short wings!\n That's the answer! What a fool I've been! All I need is a tiny little wing, all I need is to fold most of my wings and fly on just the tips alone! Short wings!\n He climbed two thousand feet above the black sea, and without a moment for thought of failure and death, he brought his forewings tightly in to his body, left only the narrow swept daggers of his wingtips extended into the wind, and fell into a vertical dive. \n The wind was a monster roar at his head. Seventy miles per hour, ninety, a hundred and twenty and faster still. The wing-strain now at a hundred and forty miles per hour wasn't nearly as hard as it had been before at seventy, and with the faintest twist of his wingtips he eased out of the dive and shot above the waves, a grey cannonball under the moon. \n He closed his eyes to slits against the wind and rejoiced. A hundred forty miles per hour! and under control! If I dive from five thousand feet instead of two thousand, I wonder how fast... \n His vows of a moment before were forgotten, swept away in that great swift wind. Yet he felt guiltless, breaking the promises he had made himself. Such promises are only for the gulls that accept the ordinary. One who has touched excellence in his learning has no need of that kind of promise. \n By sunup, Jonathan Gull was practicing again. From five thousand feet the fishing boats were specks in the flat blue water, Breakfast Flock was a faint cloud of dust motes, circling. \n He was alive, trembling ever so slightly with delight, proud that his fear was under control. Then without ceremony he hugged in his forewings, extended his short, angled wingtips, and plunged directly toward the sea. By the time he had passed four thousand feet he had reached terminal velocity, the wind was a solid beating wall of sound against which he could move no faster. He was flying now straight down, at two hundred fourteen miles per hour. He swallowed, knowing that if his wings unfolded at that speed he'd be blown into a million tiny shreds of seagull. But the speed was power, and the", "subject": "keywords_extraction", "answer": "Keywords: Morning, Sun, Sea, Fishing boat, Seagulls, Flight, Practice, Speed, Learning, Parents, Conformity, Limitations, Decision, Short wings, Vertical dive, Fear, Terminal velocity."}
