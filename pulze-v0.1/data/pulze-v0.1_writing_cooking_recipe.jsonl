Soak the saffron in 2 tbsp of the hot stock for 10 minutes. \n\n2. Heat the olive oil in a 15-inch paella pan or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until translucent. Add the garlic, paprika and oregano and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n3. Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted. \n\n4. Pour in the saffron-infused stock and the remaining hot stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, without stirring, for 10 minutes.\n\n5. Nestle the shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari into the rice in an even layer.

This results in an incredibly flavorful and texturally dynamic seafood paella."}
