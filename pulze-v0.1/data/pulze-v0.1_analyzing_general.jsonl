{"question": "sociological analysis of incest (mention various thinkers indian and western and examples)", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "Incest is a taboo subject in most societies around the world, with strong social and cultural norms against sexual relations between close family members. Sociological analysis of incest examines the social implications and consequences of these taboos.\n\nIn Western sociology, Sigmund Freud is perhaps the most well-known thinker to have explored the concept of incest. He believed that incestuous desires were universal and inherent in all individuals, but were repressed by societal norms. He argued that the Oedipus complex, where a child desires their opposite-sex parent and sees their same-sex parent as a rival, is a common psychological phenomenon that must be resolved through socialization.\n\nIn Indian sociology, scholars like M.N. Srinivas have discussed the role of kinship and family structures in shaping social norms around incest. In Indian society, the concept of gotra (lineage) plays a significant role in determining permissible marriage partners, with individuals from the same gotra considered to be close relatives and therefore forbidden from marrying each other.\n\nExamples of incest in popular culture, such as the Greek myth of Oedipus and Jocasta, or the biblical story of Lot and his daughters, highlight the moral and social consequences of incest. These narratives often depict the taboo as leading to tragedy, illustrating the societal disgust and punishment associated with incest.\n\nOverall, sociological analysis of incest reveals the complex ways in which social norms and values shape individual behavior and relationships within families. By studying the taboos surrounding incest, sociologists can gain insight into the mechanisms of social control and the boundaries of acceptable behavior in different cultures."}

I have to revise this outline and turn it into a formal outline with a lot more detail and specificity than what I have here, from both source material and my own analysis and contribution. Provide targeted, detailed and actionable suggestion. Be specific and precise. Evaluate first with what follows and then I will ask more targeted questions: A person's level of happiness is determined by their own choice and intentions. (Thesis)\nI. People can choose to be happy for the little things that happen in their lives.\n Concession: Some people may not have the choice to be happy for the little things in their lives. For example, someone that has experienced a traumatic event may not be able to find happiness.\nCounter Arguments \na. Focusing on the frequency of positive moments makes people happy.\no Keeps people happy in the long term\no Learning to be happy for the things already in your life\no For example: productive job, romantic partner, several hobbies or interests (Road to happiness/ John Reich and Ed Diener)\no Frequency, not intensity (Ed Diener)\nb.

{"question": "Perform a historical analysis of the American Civil War. Focus on the reasons behind the conflict, major battles, and the impact on society and politics. Include insights on how the war influenced the country's trajectory post-reconstruction.", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "The American Civil War, fought from 1861 to 1865, was a defining moment in American history. The conflict was primarily caused by the issue of slavery, which had been a contentious issue since the country's founding. The Southern states, which relied heavily on slave labor for their agricultural economy, sought to protect their way of life and their right to own slaves. On the other hand, the Northern states, which had a more industrialized economy and did not rely on slavery, sought to abolish the institution.\n\nThe major battles of the Civil War were fought primarily in the Southern states, with some of the most famous battles including Gettysburg, Antietam, and Vicksburg. These battles were incredibly bloody and resulted in a staggering number of casualties on both sides. The war also saw the introduction of new technologies and tactics, such as the widespread use of rifled muskets and the use of trench warfare.\n\nThe impact of the Civil War on American society and politics was profound. The war resulted in the abolition of slavery with the passage of the 13th Amendment, which forever altered the social fabric of the country. The war also solidified the power of the federal government over the states, as the Union victory established the supremacy of the federal government over the states. Additionally, the war led to the expansion of civil rights for African Americans, as the 14th and 15th Amendments granted citizenship and voting rights to freed slaves.\n\nPost-reconstruction, the Civil War continued to influence the country's trajectory. The war left a deep scar on the nation, with lasting animosities between the North and the South. The Reconstruction era, which followed the war, attempted to rebuild the country and bring about reconciliation between the North and the South. However, the failure of Reconstruction ultimately led to the rise of Jim Crow laws and the continued disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South.\n\nOverall, the American Civil War was a watershed moment in American history that fundamentally changed the country. The war's impact on society, politics, and the trajectory of the country post-reconstruction cannot be understated, as it shaped the course of American history for generations to come."}
{"question": "Write a thorough argument analysis of The New York Times columnist John Eligan’s “A Debate Over Identity and Race Asks, Are African-Americans ‘Black’ or ‘black’?”\n\nIn your argument analysis, summarize your argument’s most central claims, reasons, and assumptions.

This assignment does not require a Works Cited page.\nThe essay should be at least 5 pages long.", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "Title: A Debate Over Identity and Race Asks, Are African-Americans ‘Black’ or ‘black’?\nAuthor: John Eligan\nMain Claim: John Eligan's article explores the ongoing debate about the appropriate terminology to use when referring to African-Americans, specifically delving into the nuances of using 'Black' or 'black'. The author argues that the capitalization of the 'B' in Black is not merely a grammatical preference, but a recognition of the cultural and historical significance of the term.\n\nSummary of Central Claims, Reasons, and Assumptions:\nEligan's central claim is that the capitalization of 'Black' is a matter of respect and recognition of the unique cultural and historical identity of African-Americans. He supports this claim by providing examples of other racial and ethnic groups whose identities are capitalized, such as Asian-American, Native American, and Hispanic. Eligan assumes that his readers are open to understanding the complexities of racial and cultural identity and are willing to engage in a nuanced discussion about language and identity.\n\nLimitations and Counterarguments:\nEligan acknowledges the counterargument that the capitalization of 'Black' could be perceived as a form of special treatment or political correctness. However, he refutes this by emphasizing that the capitalization is not about special treatment, but about recognizing the unique history and culture of African-Americans. He also limits his claim by acknowledging that the debate is ongoing and that not all African-Americans agree on the issue.\n\nAppeals to Emotion and Trust:\nEligan effectively appeals to emotion by sharing personal anecdotes and experiences, which help to humanize the issue and make it more relatable. For example, he shares his own experience of being corrected when using 'black' instead of 'Black', which helps to establish trust with the reader. He also uses emotional language, such as \"a matter of respect\" and \"a recognition of cultural and historical significance\", to emphasize the importance of the issue.\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses:\nThe strength of Eligan's argument lies in his ability to present a nuanced and respectful discussion about a complex issue. He effectively uses examples and personal anecdotes to support his claim, and he acknowledges and responds to counterarguments. However, one potential weakness is that he does not provide a comprehensive overview of the debate, which could leave some readers wanting more information.\n\nOverall Assessment:\nJohn Eligan's article is a thought-provoking exploration of the debate surrounding the appropriate terminology to use when referring to African-Americans. While the article could benefit from a more comprehensive overview of the debate, it effectively presents a compelling argument for the capitalization of 'Black' as a matter of respect and recognition of cultural and historical significance. The author's use of personal anecdotes and emotional language helps to establish trust with the reader and make the issue more relatable. Overall, the article is a valuable contribution to the ongoing discussion about language and identity."}
{"question": "Rate my metaphor for my language arts assignment. Here it is. \"Each person is a river. Like our emotions, this river is usually calm but can sometimes rush or flow unevenly. When we are born, this river is in its most youthful, untouched form, perhaps as ice on the top of a mountain. But as it flows down, it brings along little pieces of the rocks it has touched, each one a small memory, thought, hope, or dream we carry with us as we grow. As this river keeps flowing, it will find its way to other rivers and join with them, as you will find your way into this world. The people you surround yourself with, the rivers you merge with, may either flow the beautiful water lilies or dirt and debris your way. Your river will be filled with those things, whether good or bad, as you live this life.\n\nBut as your health declines, this river dries.

{"question": "Highlight and discuss two salient points or unique selling proposition of EV vehicles as compared to conventional vehicles, and why do you think EV can succeed in market penetration", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "1. Environmental Impact: One of the main selling points of electric vehicles (EVs) is their significantly lower environmental impact compared to conventional vehicles. EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, which helps reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This is particularly important in combating climate change and improving air quality in urban areas. Additionally, EVs are more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles, as they convert a higher percentage of energy from the grid into propulsion.\n\n2. Lower Operating Costs: Another key advantage of EVs is their lower operating costs compared to conventional vehicles. EVs have fewer moving parts, which results in reduced maintenance and servicing requirements. Additionally, electricity is typically cheaper than gasoline, leading to lower fuel costs for EV owners. Over the lifetime of the vehicle, the savings on maintenance and fuel can offset the higher upfront cost of purchasing an EV.\n\nEVs have the potential to succeed in market penetration for several reasons. Firstly, advancements in battery technology have led to improvements in range and charging infrastructure, addressing concerns about limited driving range and long charging times. Additionally, government incentives and regulations promoting clean energy vehicles are making EVs more attractive to consumers. As more automakers invest in electric vehicle technology and expand their EV offerings, the market for EVs is expected to grow. Ultimately, as awareness of the environmental benefits and cost savings of EVs increases, more consumers are likely to make the switch to electric vehicles, driving further market penetration."}

{"question": "Investigate the environmental consequences of intensive farming practices on soil health and biodiversity. Analyze the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and monoculture farming. Suggest sustainable agricultural alternatives that minimize ecological impact.", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "Intensive farming practices, such as the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and monoculture farming, have significant negative impacts on soil health and biodiversity. \n\nPesticides are chemicals used to control pests that can harm crops. While they can increase crop yields, they also have negative effects on soil health and biodiversity. Pesticides can kill beneficial organisms in the soil, disrupt microbial communities, and contaminate water sources. This can lead to soil degradation, reduced soil fertility, and harm to non-target species. \n\nFertilizers are used to provide essential nutrients to crops, but excessive use can lead to nutrient runoff into water sources, causing eutrophication and harming aquatic ecosystems. Fertilizers can also disrupt the natural nutrient cycling in soil, leading to imbalances and reduced soil health over time. \n\nMonoculture farming, where only one type of crop is grown over a large area, can also harm soil health and biodiversity. Monoculture farming depletes soil nutrients specific to certain crops, leading to decreased soil fertility and increased vulnerability to pests and diseases. It also reduces habitat diversity for wildlife and can lead to the loss of important species in the ecosystem. \n\nTo minimize the ecological impact of intensive farming practices, sustainable agricultural alternatives should be implemented. These include practices such as crop rotation, cover cropping, integrated pest management, and agroforestry. \n\nCrop rotation involves alternating the types of crops grown in a field over time, which helps to maintain soil fertility and reduce pest and disease pressure. Cover cropping involves planting non-cash crops to protect and enrich the soil during fallow periods. Integrated pest management focuses on using a combination of biological, cultural, and mechanical methods to control pests, reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides. Agroforestry involves integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural systems, providing multiple benefits such as improved soil health, biodiversity, and climate resilience. \n\nBy adopting these sustainable agricultural practices, farmers can reduce the negative impacts of intensive farming on soil health and biodiversity, while also improving long-term productivity and resilience of their farms."}

{"question": "Write an essay comparing the following two perspectives on Juneteenth and describe any insight that can be gained from the comparison. \n\nArgument 1: an excerpt from \"\"\"\"The True Meaning of Juneteenth\"\"\"\" by Casey Gerald:\n\n\"\"\"\"...This Juneteenth, those are the feelings I’m channeling: grief and gratitude, even amid the silliness of America’s pageantry. My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen’s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, “You’ve got to know your history.” She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. “Child, don’t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,” she’d explain. “Everybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn’t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?” This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, “The murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.” The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom — their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother’s perspective. She’d heard the testimonies of those who’d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn’t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it’s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice’s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history — who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears — or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you.\"\"\"\" \n\nArgument 2: an excerpt from \"\"\"\"Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty\"\"\"\" by Peter Coy: \n\n\"\"\"\"...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. “The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,” a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the “and a mule” part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land — and thus true independence — to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages — about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, “The paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.” Today, the phrase “wage slavery” invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn’t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom — which must include economic freedom — is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.\"\"\n\nComparison of the two perspectives on Juneteenth and discussion of insights to be gained from the comparison:", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "Casey Gerald's perspective on Juneteenth, as presented in \"The True Meaning of Juneteenth,\" emphasizes the importance of remembering and honoring the past, with all its complexities and tragedies. Gerald highlights the violence and terror faced by formerly enslaved individuals during the Reconstruction period, as well as the enormous price they paid for freedom. He encourages Black Americans to grieve for their ancestors and express gratitude for their sacrifices, while also acknowledging the ongoing struggle for justice and respect.\n\nPeter Coy's perspective, as expressed in \"Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty,\" focuses on the unfulfilled promise of land and true independence for formerly enslaved individuals following the end of slavery. Coy connects the historical struggles of African Americans to achieve economic freedom with the present-day wealth gap between Black and white families. He suggests that modern solutions to inequality should include unionization, government regulation, and profit-sharing, which can contribute to greater economic freedom for all.\n\nComparing the two perspectives offers valuable insights on the importance of understanding both the historical and contemporary dimensions of Juneteenth. By acknowledging the past and honoring the sacrifices of those who fought for freedom, as Gerald suggests, we can develop a deeper appreciation for the ongoing struggle for justice and equality. At the same time, Coy's emphasis on economic freedom highlights the need to address systemic issues that continue to disadvantage African Americans and other marginalized communities.\n\nBy considering both perspectives, we can recognize the multifaceted nature of Juneteenth and the importance of commemorating both the legal end of slavery and the ongoing quest for economic independence and true equality. In doing so, we can foster a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of Juneteenth and its significance for contemporary conversations about race, justice, and freedom."}

{"question": "Analyze the following paragraph and the tone of the written information\n\nA Comparative Analysis of Different Medical Imaging Techniques \n Medical imaging exams are an essential tool for healthcare professionals to diagnose and monitor various medical conditions. Radiologic studies such as x-rays, computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scans use ionizing radiation to produce images of the body's internal structures.Whereas, noninvasive imaging exams, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasounds, do not use ionizing radiation to create images.\n Radiologic studies are invasive procedures that use ionizing radiation to create images of the internal structures of the body. The most common radiologic exam, is an X-ray, which is used to visualize bones and some soft tissues structures such as the lungs. They tend to be the best exam for detecting bone fractures. CT scans, on the other hand, are more detailed than x-rays and can produce 3D images of the body's internal structures. Also this type of exam is good for detecting internal bleeding. For instance, if a patient has a subarachnoid hemorrhage this can give doctors a clear picture of the affected section. Moreover, PET scans are used to detect metabolic activity in the body and can aid in the diagnosis of certain cancers and other diseases. It can also detect if the cancer has already metastasized. While radiologic studies are essential for diagnosing many medical conditions, their use of ionizing radiation can pose health risks, including radiation-induced cancer. \n On the contrary, Noninvasive imaging exams, including MRI and ultrasounds, do not use ionizing radiation to create images. MRI creates detailed images of the body’s internal structures by using a powerful magnetic field and radio waves. MRI is particularly useful in imaging anatomical soft tissue structures, such as organs and muscles, and it is frequently used to diagnose conditions such as brain and spinal cord injuries, as well as joint and musculoskeletal problems. Ultrasounds, on the other hand, produce real-time images of internal organs and tissues by using high-frequency sound waves. They are commonly used in obstetrics and gynecology to visualize the fetus during pregnancy and to diagnose conditions such as ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids.\n Other types of imaging studies exist in addition to radiologic and noninvasive imaging exams. Endoscopic studies involve the use of a flexible tube with a camera attached to visualize the body's internal structures. They are often used to diagnose conditions in the digestive system, including ulcers and cancers. additionally Electro diagnostic studies, such as Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and Electrocardiograms (EKGs), involve measuring the electrical activity of the body's organs. EEGs are commonly used to diagnose neurological conditions such as, epilepsy’s, seizures, sleep disorders, depth of anesthesia, brain death, and coma (this recording may last about 20-30mins), while EKGs are used to record electrical activity of the heart to diagnose heart conditions. This study tends to see three main components which are: the P wave (depolarization of the atriums), the QRS wave (depolarization of the ventricles), and the T wave (repolarization of the ventricles). For example if a study demonstrates a P wave absence and it is \"irregularly irregular” this means the person has an atrial fibrillation because the screen will be showing a thread like pattern meaning the heart lacks a sinus beat.", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "The tone of the paragraph is informative and educational.

However, this increased processing power comes at a cost - transformers require significant computational resources to train and deploy effectively. This raises concerns about accessibility and equity in the field of NLP, as not all researchers or organizations may have access to the necessary computing power to take full advantage of transformer models.\n\nAdditionally, while transformers have been shown to outperform traditional models in terms of accuracy and efficiency, their increased complexity can make them harder to interpret and understand. This lack of interpretability can be a barrier to adoption in fields such as healthcare, where transparency and trust in AI systems are crucial.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on speed and efficiency in transformer models may come at the expense of robustness and generalizability. By prioritizing training time and computational efficiency, there is a risk of overlooking potential biases or limitations in the data used to train these models, which could have serious implications in critical applications such as clinical decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, while transformers represent a significant advancement in the field of NLP and data analysis, it is important to approach their adoption critically and thoughtfully. As we continue to explore the potential of transformer models in healthcare and other industries, it is essential to consider not only their technical capabilities but also their ethical and societal implications."}

These symptoms result from an overgrowth of ectopic endometrial tissue2. Endometriosis is commonly misdiagnosed for several reasons, the most notable being that pelvic pain is a symptom which overlaps with other gynecological diseases, and the lack of knowledge regarding its pathogenesis3.\n\nHowever, research demonstrates that endometriosis is a partly genetically inherited disease (with a heritability of ~50%)4,5 By defining the genetic profile of endometriosis, genetic screening could provide an alternative diagnosis method and eliminate unnecessary diagnostic procedures, which would facilitate patients receiving the treatment they require.\n\nRecently, genome research tools have been developed, such as genome-wide association (GWA) studies and exome sequencing. Through GWA studies, several candidate genes associated with endometriosis risk have been discovered, which will be discussed further on in light of a systematic literature review on endometriosis GWA studies. On the other hand, exome sequencing of endometriosis has been conducted in very few studies; there are no relevant systematic literature reviews published to date. Thus, a case-control study in Greece (Matalliotakis et al, 2017)6 will be discussed to illustrate the importance of investing in exome sequencing.\n\nIn light of this research, this paper proposes a novel combined research method of GWA and exome sequencing studies, addressing the lack of multidisciplinary studies on this topic. This could contribute to identifying the endometriosis genome, which is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.\n\nA systematic review of GWA-studies of endometriosis\nA GWA study takes a large population of patients that share a characteristic (ie, a disease) and a population of controls that do not share this characteristic. Then, the most frequently appearing genetic risk variants in these genomes are highlighted and considered as possible contributing genes to this characteristic—in this case endometriosis risk. These highlighted genes are the candidate genes.\n\nIn 2020, Cardoso et al7 published a systematic literature review on endometriosis. The goal of this systematic review was to describe the candidate genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified thus far, and to discuss the conflicting results of these 15 studies. The results of this review pointed to 11 candidate genes or SNPs that might be associated with an increased endometriosis risk. However, the authors identified a number of confounding factors, the most notable being the overrepresentation of Caucasian patients, and the small sample sizes of many studies. Therefore, the authors emphasize the importance of conducting GWA studies on large populations of differing ethnic backgrounds to accurately identify the risk variants specific to these distinct populations.\n\nExome sequencing of endometriosis: a study in Greece\nSimilar to GWA studies, exome sequencing selects a patient population and a control group. A specific portion of DNA of these populations are sequenced, which contain the loci of the candidate genes found through GWA studies. Then, a correlation between the possible risk variants and the disease is determined. Mutations in protein-coding DNA sequences contribute to increased disease risk. Therefore, exome sequencing does not sequence the entire genome—which includes junk DNA as well—but only the exome. Therefore, exome sequencing is a cost-effective approach to genome research, which is interesting for conducting these studies in larger quantities, globally.\n\nIn a population of 166 Greek women with endometriosis and 150 controls, Matalliotakis et al (2017)6 examined three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine if they were correlated with endometriosis risk. These SNPs were rs7521902, rs10859871, rs11031006 which map to the genetic loci WNT4, VEZT, and FSHB, respectively. These SNPs were selected based on a meta-analysis of GWA studies8. Their findings indicate that the allele variants located on the loci WNT4 and FSHB could be correlated with endometriosis risk. These results are promising and could extend our knowledge of endometriosis genomics. However, they may not be applicable to every population.\n\nThe importance of combining GWAS and exome sequencing, and discussing study parameters\nGWA studies are a fairly novel tool to quickly identify the allele frequency in patients’ genomes to find a relatively plausible set of candidate genes, which subsequently can be examined in exome sequencing studies. However, there are underlying genetic factors that complicate the study of endometriosis genomics. For instance, epistatic reactions, where one gene variant can “overshadow” another gene, thereby rendering the causal gene unidentifiable1. This is, as of date, impossible to examine through the software used in GWA studies due to limited computational power. Thus, the use of exome sequencing to fill in these gaps of genetical information will be crucial to unravel the endometriosis genome1.\n\nHowever, exome sequencing remains critically dependent on reliable GWA data. More specifically, small sample size, lack of ethnic diversity, and incomplete patient characteristics are detrimental to the proper interpretation of a GWA study1. In the study by Matalliotakis et al (2017)6, candidate genes association rates differed according to clinical disease stage. Thus, Lalami et al1 insist that classifying patients according to their clinical characteristics is a key component to improving the detection of relevant candidate genes.\n\nThe inheritable nature of endometriosis has been well established for decades. The study of genome-wide association has improved our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease. However, endometriosis is heterogeneous and complex; its genomics have yet to be extensively researched to the point where these findings can be utilized in clinical practice. The limited amount of research published to date is a testament to this. Clearly, additional exome sequencing studies are required.\n\nOverall, researchers agree on the need to conduct GWA studies in large, ethnically diverse, and clinically well characterized patient populations.. This is expected to yield a selection of reliable candidate genes which in turn may be investigated thoroughly in smaller (familial) populations through exome sequencing. Narrowing down this selection will ensure that exome sequencing can be utilized cost-effectively, therefore more studies may be conducted. Consequently, our knowledge of its pathogenesis can be broadened. This would lead to opportunities in developing medicine for treatment and genetic screenings for diagnoses. As a result, women with endometriosis would benefit from this advancement in women’s medical health.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n1. Lalami I, Abo C, Borghese B, Chapron C, Vaiman D.

{"question": "please evaluate my student's answer about multitasking\nThe centrality of multitasking in teenagers’ lives has triggered vast interest in popular and academic discussion. Due to a large inconsistency in the study and multitasking reporting, we endeavoured to better understand and characterize multitasking behaviors. We researched multitasking patterns, prevalence, types, combinations and gender differences of adolescents using observations, in-depth interviews and questionnaires. The results showed a large variety of multitasking prevalence and types that we categorized as simultaneous multitasking and task switching. Most of the observed multitasking was actually task switching with a higher frequency of multitasking during leisure than during study time. An interesting finding is a connection between the natures of tasks: passive, active or incidental and the multitasking type. We demonstrated that most multitasking involved combinations of music, texting or activities on social networks, but seldom combining video games. Gender differences in multitasking were also observed, especially with regard to the nature of the task combinations.", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "This answer provides a thorough evaluation of the research conducted on multitasking behaviors in teenagers.

{"question": "What feedback can you give for this essay: I gently open my eyes after a refreshing nap and turned my head towards the blinding light of the digital clock. It showed that it is 3 AM which bewildered the 5-year-old me. I slowly realised that I was alone in my living room, on the couch, with not a single soul wandering around. The house was surrounded by the shadows of the night. The sky was overcast with dark clouds and I could perceive the sound of the chilly wind howling fiercely. My vision was still hazy and dim. Out of the blue, a streak of light flashed across the sky’s dark canvas, followed by an ear-splitting clap of thunder. Soon after, I froze, immobilised by fear. \n\nI tried to stand up but my legs were heavy to carry me and I was trembling like a leaf. The crackling of the thunderstorm continued striking down from the heavens in irregular and unpredictable intervals. I staggered in the direction of the staircase while cold sweat trickled down my forehead. I could only touch the nearby obstacles blocking my way in the pitch-black room, illuminated through the windows by the moon and stars outside. The storm, however, has yet to subside as it intensified every second. The torrential rain sent tremors down every fiber of my body. When I finally reached the door to my room, I shut every window and isolated myself from the clangour of the pouring rain. The only problem would be the thunderclaps causing my ears to ring. \n\nThe digital clock next to my bed was turned off, possibly caused by a power outage. I lay on my bed and covered my ears with a blanket. The peal of thunder was unaffected by the walls and window of my room. Whenever I glanced at the window or the ceiling, multiple bright light flashes my eyes, giving off an afterimage. I buried my face into the bed as the thunderstorm raged fiercely, keeping me awake. I lost track of time and only wished that dawn would arrive and I would open my eyes to a bright, glorious day.", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "Overall, this essay does a good job of creating a suspenseful and atmospheric scene during a thunderstorm. The descriptive language used effectively sets the mood and helps the reader visualize the setting. However, there are a few areas that could be improved:\n\n1.

Show more of the character's emotions and thoughts throughout the experience to help the reader connect with the protagonist on a deeper level. How does the character feel about being alone during the storm? What thoughts are running through their mind as they navigate through the dark house?\n\n3. Provide more sensory details to fully immerse the reader in the scene. Descriptions of sounds, smells, and textures can enhance the reader's experience and make the setting feel more vivid.\n\nOverall, with some revisions to enhance pacing, emotional depth, and sensory detail, this essay could be even more engaging and impactful."}

Scott Fitzgerald's acclaimed novel, serves as a poignant critique of the American Dream, a concept deeply ingrained in the nation's psyche. Through the enigmatic character of Jay Gatsby, Fitzgerald crafts a metaphor that exposes the hollowness and unattainability of this idealized pursuit of wealth, status, and happiness. Gatsby's lavish parties, opulent mansion, and unwavering obsession with recapturing the past symbolize the superficial trappings of success that ultimately fail to fulfill the deeper yearnings of the human spirit. His tragic downfall underscores the futility of chasing an illusory dream built upon false pretenses and the relentless pursuit of material possessions."}

III:2 Sentence one, Art.III:2 sentence two and Art. III:4. Apply this differentiated standards individually for the three examples. Also apple does not refers to the fruit but to the brand for electronic devices such as the iphone.", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "The concept of \"likeness\" in WTO law is used to determine whether two products are similar enough to be considered directly competitive with each other. This concept is important because it helps to establish whether discrimination between products is justified under Article III of the GATT, which prohibits discrimination between imported and domestic products.\n\nThe Appellate Body refers to an accordion in its discussion of likeness because the concept of likeness can be stretched or contracted, much like an accordion, depending on the context and specific circumstances of each case.\n\nIn Article III:2 of the GATT, the first sentence states that imported and domestic products should be treated equally if they are \"like products\", meaning they are identical or similar in nature, characteristics, or end uses. The second sentence of Article III:2 allows for differentiation between products if there are differences in the way they are taxed or regulated.\n\nOn the other hand, Article III:4 of the GATT prohibits internal taxation or other internal charges on imported products that are higher than those imposed on domestic products.\n\nNow, let's assess the likeness of the following pairs of products:\n\n1. Gruyère cheese and Provolone cheese:\nBoth Gruyère and Provolone cheeses are types of cheese, so they are likely to be considered like products under Article III:2. However, they may have differences in taste, texture, and usage that could justify different treatment under the second sentence of Article III:2.\n\n2. Apple and Samsung:\nApple and Samsung are both electronic devices, but they are produced by different companies and have different features and operating systems. Therefore, they are not likely to be considered like products under Article III:2. They would be subject to different treatment under the second sentence of Article III:2.\n\n3. Rice and pasta:\nRice and pasta are both food products, but they have different ingredients, cooking methods, and cultural significance. They may be considered like products under Article III:2, but could still be subject to different treatment under the second sentence of Article III:2.\n\nIn summary, the assessment of likeness under Article III:2 Sentence one focuses on the similarity of products, while Sentence two allows for differentiation based on specific characteristics. Article III:4 prohibits discrimination based on internal taxation or charges. Each of the three examples provided would require a detailed analysis of their specific characteristics to determine their likeness and potential for differential treatment under the relevant provisions of the GATT."}

The response should be concise and easy to understand.\n\nMy first task is Montage Essay, “I Love/I Know” Type\n\nI’ve spent most of my life as an anti-vegetable carboholic. For years, processed snack foods ruled the kitchen kingdom of my household and animal products outnumbered plant-based offerings. \n\nMy transformation began with my mom’s cancer diagnosis. My mom went on a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I fully embraced this new eating philosophy to show my support. Eager to figure out the whole “vegan” thing, the two of us started binge-watching health documentaries such as “What the Health” and “Forks Over Knives”. We read all the books by the featured doctors like “The China Study” and “How Not To Die”. I became entranced by the world of nutritional science and how certain foods could help prevent cancer or boost metabolism. \n\nEach new food I discovered gave me an education on the role diet plays on health. I learned that, by eating sweet potatoes and brown rice, you could cure acne and heart disease. I discovered eating leafy greens with citrus fruits could boost iron absorption rates. I loved pairing my foods to create the perfect macronutrient balance. Did you know beans and rice make a complete protein? \n\nFood has also turned me into a sustainability nut. Living plant-based also saves the planet from the impact of animal agriculture. For the same amount of land space, a farmer can produce 200 kilograms of soybeans versus 16 kilograms of beef. I do my part to have as small of an ecological footprint as I can. I stopped using plastic snack bags and instead turned to reusable beeswax wraps. My favorite reusable appliance is my foldable straw. If I am going to nourish my body, shouldn’t I also want to nourish the earth? \n\nMy journey toward healthy living led me to becoming co-leader of the Northern Nevada PlantPure Pod, “Biggest Little Plant Pod”, a group dedicated to spreading the message about the whole food plant-based lifestyle. We are currently working on a restaurant campaign to encourage local eateries to create a plant-based, oil-free menu option and become PlantPure certified. After discovering how many restaurants use oil in their cooking, I decided I needed to open a plant-based oil free cafe to make up for this gap. My dream is to open up my very own affordable oatmeal cafe based on my Instagram page, morning\\_mOATivations. And I know that oatmeal isn’t the sexiest superfood out there, so here’s my sales pitch: I’m going to make oatmeal the Beyonce of the breakfast world- sweet, sassy, and power packed. This allows me to educate people about nutritional science through the stomach. \n\nFinally, I am a strong proponent of hands-on experience for learning what good food looks and tastes like, so cooking is one of my favorite ways to teach the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Using my taste buds as my textbook to learn which flavors work together and which ones don’t helps me educate, as I’ve found that information tends to stick in a person’s mind once they’ve experienced healthy, delicious foods with their own senses. Our society has taught us that delicious food has to make us feel guilty, when that is simply not the case. The best feeling in the world is falling in love with a dish and then learning all the health benefits that it provides the body.\n\nWhile my classmates complain about being tired, I have more energy because my body is finally getting the right macros, vitamins, and minerals it needs. This has allowed me to push myself harder physically, excelling in running and earning my high school Cross Country team’s Most Improved award. I’m still a picky eater. But the foods I am particular about have changed. Rather than a carboholic, I choose to call myself a vegeholic..

{"question": "Is this a good personal statement for college application:\n\"\"Ting.” The sound notified me that I had successfully uploaded the first video to YouTube. I was eleven at that time and loved watching people conduct physics experiments. YouTubers like Walter Lewin and Steve Spangler occupied entire weekends, and it became a childhood dream of mine to be like them someday.\nOf course, I was only a kid and did not know anything about making videos, nor did I have the money for any recording equipment. Despite all this, I still wanted to try something. So, I used my family’s iPad to record a simple upside-down water glass experiment. It was janky since I had to prop up the iPad and wrap my arms around it while also making sure not to splash water onto the camera. After that, I used Windows Movie Maker to edit the footage before publishing my first YouTube video.\nOne. Ten. One hundred. Subscribers surged as I shared my YouTube channel with family and friends. This instant flow inspired me to create the following videos and even convinced me that the day of becoming a famous YouTuber was not far away.\nBut that illusion did not last long. The number of new subscribers kept dwindling, even though I purchased professional editing software and spent hours adding effects to my videos to make them look like those of other YouTubers. The feeling that being a creator was not for me slowly grew. With schoolwork getting more demanding and extracurriculars occupying more and more of my time, I decided to put my childhood dream aside.\nTime flew. Three years later, I was admitted to the school’s physics team. I thought my passion for conducting experiments would be satisfied here, but it turned out not. The teacher monotonously assigned exercises to students and then asked them to present their work on the board. Deep inside, I knew physics was more exciting than that.\nI wanted to share interesting experiment videos with everyone, demonstrating how physics is applied in everyday life. But at the same time, I was scared that my clips were not good enough compared to those of the Youtubers I admired. I promised myself I would return to YouTube once I had enough money to invest in modern equipment to make quality videos. But that day would never come if I kept hesitating.\nFortunately, an opportunity has come and urged me to continue the path where I had left off. At the end of the course, each student was required to record a physics experiment related to what they had learned. I chose my favorite: the upside-down water glass experiment. To my surprise, my video was praised for its creativity. My nickname, “science magic boy,” became widespread in the class.\nI started organizing live experiments at school, which attracted many attendees. I also uploaded video recordings of those performances to my old YouTube channel so that people living far away could watch them. The number of subscribers was no longer crucial to me; I only hoped my videos could reach students whose schools did not have the resources to conduct practical experiments. Instead of competing, I wanted to be a part of the YouTuber community, sharing interesting scientific knowledge with everyone. Thus, with a casual attitude, I continued to make new physics experiment videos.\n“Ting. Ting. Ting.” I woke up one day to a bunch of notifications from YouTube, and as I read them, I started becoming a little emotional. However insignificant it may seem, reading how people found my videos helpful for their journeys in school reminded me of how I felt toward the YouTubers I used to watch. It was the first time I felt like the work I put into these videos was amounting to something. That feeling motivated me to improve so I could help more people in any way possible.\"", "subject": "analyzing_general", "answer": "This is a very strong personal statement for a college application.
