{"question": "I'm writing a technical paper with the following abstract:\n\nAmong the deep generative models, variational autoencoders (VAEs) are the pioneers in generating new samples from a learned, latent space while effectively reconstructing input data. However, the original formulation requires a stochastic sampling operation, implemented via the reparameterization trick, to approximate a posterior latent distribution. In this paper, we propose a new method that inputs the complete distributions of the encoded input into the decoder, effectively optimizing the model for the entire range of data instead of discrete samples. We treat\nthe encoded distributions as continuous random variables and use operations defined by the algebra of random variables during decoding. Experiments on different datasets and architectures demonstrate that this modification improves VAE-based architectures‚Äô performance. Specifically,\nour approach improves reconstruction error and generative capabilities, as measured by the Fr ÃÅechet Inception Distance (FID) metric, while exhibiting similar or better training convergence behavior. The project‚Äôs code will be made publicly available.\n\nCan you propose a title?

As of 2:30 pm ET, an hour after his tweet, the account appeared to be restored.\n\nTwitter, which has cut much of its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN. In a tweet, Twitter owner Elon Musk said the account was ‚Äúincorrectly flagged as impersonation.‚Äù\n\nThe suspension marks the second time in a month that Twitter has briefly suspended a sitting US senator.

As risks become more complex and interconnected, organizations must leverage technology, including AI-driven tools, to enhance their risk management strategies. \n\nToday, private and public sector organizations use massive amounts of internal and external data to manage risk, a Deloitte Advisory article points out. ‚ÄúHowever, traditional methods of analysis have become increasingly incapable of handling this data volume,‚Äù the article continues. ‚ÄúInstead, cognitive capabilities‚Äîincluding data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing‚Äîare supplanting traditional analytics and being applied against these massive data sets to help find indicators of known and unknown risks.\n\nRead on to learn about the importance of technology in risk management and how AI-powered tools can revolutionize how risks are identified, monitored, and mitigated.\nLeveraging AI to Better Monitor Key Topics\nEffective risk management relies on the ability to monitor relevant topics and detect emerging trends and threats. Traditional methods of topic monitoring can be clunky and time-consuming, often resulting in missed signals or delayed responses. That‚Äôs where AI-powered tools like Predata‚Äôs Topic Builder feature come into play.\n\nWithin Predata, Topics are collections of thematically-related webpages. Users can create their own for people, places, things, entities, ideas, and concepts they want to monitor. Predata‚Äôs Topic Builder tool uses AI to help users determine what themes and keywords they want to track. ‚ÄúUsers get suggestions of things related to the subject they want to track,‚Äù says Steven Childress, director of product management at Predata. ‚ÄúThen we take that prompt and ask artificial intelligence to learn what it is and figure out different aspects of it.‚Äù From there, users get a list of categories to track, along with associated web pages. ‚ÄúThis gives customers the keys to the car so they can tailor the use of the platform to their specific needs,‚Äù Childress says.\n\nBy harnessing the power of AI, topic monitoring is made more intuitive. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from diverse sources in real time, providing valuable insights and early warnings about potential risks. \n\nTools like the Topic Builder take a big issue, such as ‚Äúhow the U.S. is perceived globally,‚Äù and find sub-issues within that theme ‚Äî for instance, controversies re", "subject": "title_generation", "answer": "1.

The feature will roll out to users globally in the ‚Äúcoming weeks,‚Äù the company says. (How it will work at launch is up for debate: some users were reporting being routed to gas stations instead of EV chargers.)\n\nWaze briefly trialed adding EV chargers to its route planning tool back in 2021 in partnership with Volkswagen. But that trial only lasted a few weeks, and after it concluded, the charging stations vanished from the app. With today‚Äôs announcement, Waze has added EV charging ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù to the app, a company spokesperson said.\n\nWaze also claims that thanks to its crowdsourced map editing function, ‚ÄúEV data is reviewed and updated in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCharging station information is often inconsistent, outdated or unreliable, creating a major pain point for EV drivers who may navigate to a charging station only to discover they can‚Äôt find it or use it,‚Äù Waze says in a blog post. ‚ÄúBy adding up-to-date EV charging information to the Waze map, it‚Äôs even easier to charge your car and get help finding where or when you‚Äôll come across the next station.‚Äù\n\nWaze is not the only navigation app trying to improve the experience of finding a working EV charger. Google, which owns Waze, has been tweaking its own flagship app, Google Maps, including information about the types of plugs present at certain charging stations and whether those plugs are currently in use. The company also recently upgraded EV charging searches for electric vehicles with Google built-in software.\n\nThere is a host of EV charging navigation tools, from A Better Route Planner to PlugShare to Chargeway. All have their upsides and downsides. But with these new updates, Waze may soon rise to the top of the list of preferred services by EV owners.\nWaze route plans will now include electric vehicle charger locations\nEV drivers now have one more option for planning the best route with charging.\n\nElectric vehicle-specific navigation is coming to Waze. The map app is rolling out new data beginning today that now includes EV charger location information, which it will use to help EV drivers plan routes.\n\nThe new app feature will let you specify your EV type and the relevant charging plug, which you can use to filter just the appropriate charging stations. Waze says that its community will review and update the map data \"in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.\"\n\nWaze's addition of EV charger location data now gives EV drivers yet another route-planning tool. Apps like PlugShare and A Better Route Planner are both widely used by EV drivers to find chargers, and both Apple Maps and Google Maps have EV-routing features now as well.\n\nAnd as EV drivers already know, it's common practice for all but the barest-bones EV to feature charger locations in their onboard navigation system. In fact, it can be preferable to use that option rather than casting from one's phone, as many EVs will precondition the battery for faster charging if the native navigation app has a charger set as the destination.\n\nWaze will begin rolling out the EV data from today, although it says it will do so globally \"over the coming weeks.\"", "subject": "title_generation", "answer": "\"Waze Revolutionizes Route Planning with Real-Time Electric Vehicle Charging Station Locator\""}

Even though he has a short life compared to many, he went through quite a journey so far. He still figuring things out as he gets older and still trying to find out who he is. He came to a conclusion recently and finally realized he never made a decision truly for himself. He did what others felt was best for him, and he always went along because he didn‚Äôt want to make waves. Not anymore, he‚Äôs determined to be his own person. Let‚Äôs take a look at a few experiences and piece them together to try to understand his fast-paced and confusing life.\nBorn on March 30, 1999, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Koa entered the world. For the first six years and one week of his life, he lived in North Carolina. Then suddenly, a week after he just turned six. He, his three older sisters, and his mother are heading for Oahu. And for the next sixteen years, he lived up and down the west coast of Oahu.

They took a trip the year prior to visit his aunt and his grandma. It was his first-ever trip, and no less it was Christmas time when they went. So looking forward to going back so quickly on another ‚Äúvacation‚Äù there was exciting.\nAt such a young age he didn‚Äôt understand what was really going on. He wondered why his dad was the one dropping us off and why he was so sad. He saw that his sisters were sad as well, so he felt sad too not knowing why. It wasn‚Äôt until a week in he realized that his father wouldn‚Äôt be joining them. ‚ÄúI and your father are getting divorced,‚Äù His mother told him. Little did he know at such a young age what those words meant. It wouldn‚Äôt be long to feel the strain of being different from those who had both parents. Persistently being asked, ‚Äúwhere is your dad? why don‚Äôt you have a dad?‚Äù and all the while Koa didn‚Äôt know how to answer them in the slightest. To get away from this, he remembers always going to the health room. Almost every week he‚Äôd go at least twice, His health room card almost being as thick as a small book by the end of the year. He wasn‚Äôt sick at all, he didn‚Äôt want to be bothered by anyone. Truth was, this young man was experiencing depression. And with such adverse effects at a young age, it was hard for him to open up. \nThat wasn‚Äôt the only trial he faced. Coming from a more southern area along with having an accent, and being one of the fairest kids at school, he felt even isolated. One of the worst experiences was between him and a classmate. ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs a nice flag drawing you got in your binder, what country is that?‚Äù Koa ask. ‚ÄúYeah, I drew it, and it‚Äôs from the Philippines.‚Äù His classmate replies. Coming from a mixed ethnic family, Koa thought this be a good chance to make another friend with similar interests. ‚ÄúReally? I‚Äôm Filipino too! I got Illicano and Visayan.‚Äù Koa exclaims. ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôll never be a real Filipino and never will have my flag or draw as good as me.‚Äù his classmate scoffs. ‚ÄúUuuuhhhh ok, never asked for your flag and I‚Äôll still be Filipino.‚Äù Koa kinda just stares blankly and walks into his classroom trying to figure out why exactly they said that. He encountered many racially charged experiences but none bothered him as much as that one. Not till years later will he just conclude, ‚ÄúSome people are just too proud and won‚Äôt accept others, that‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll be proud regardless of what others think,‚Äù he smirks as he thinks to himself. \nKoa did in fact have a knack for drawing. Certainly not the best with characters or such. He did excel with cars and buildings, Koa was known for drawing Most of the time during elementary and middle school you‚Äôd find him in class or the library sketching away on grid paper. Why grid paper? Sometime in fifth grade, he was handed a scholastic magazine with blueprints on them. He always drew and was now introduced to architecture. What better than to mesh one hobby with an entirely new one?! So for the coming years, he spent drawing cities upon cities. Creating countless random modern homes on them. He taped them together to make one long picture. This project took up most of his time, and that didn‚Äôt bother him much. One thing about Koa during these times, he didn‚Äôt have many friends and wasn‚Äôt as social as he is now. He struggled, for the most part, to be who he truly was as he haven‚Äôt gotten to explore many pathways life had to offer.\nThat changed when he got his driver‚Äôs license. Yet another significant change in his life. A new door had been open for the young man, finally able to go out and explore as he always wanted. For most of his life, he would just stay home. A pretty mundane way of life. Go to school, go back home, do chores and that's it. No longer did he have to be anchored or restricted to be stuck at home. Even more so after high school, he got his very first car. The first opportunity to be ankle to socialize freely without having to rely on his mother to take him. Taking full advantage of his opportunity, he goes out with many childhood friends who were as easily accessible to associate with. He starts to be more active and in turn more social when he goes out. Constantly going to the park, playing soccer, able to stay out later. he gains the sense off freedom he never felt before. The young man keeps seeking more and finds a job that is enough to allow him to have time and money. But as time goes on, ‚ÄúHow realistic is this way of life?‚Äù he poses this question to himself.\n As of recent, Koa has been going through another change. It has been quite a perplexing situation; Koa wants to take another step to mature but has realized that by only following the ones who have been trying to help he enable himself. He understands the one who has been trying to help prepare him for the world, but how can he help himself he has been asking recently. ‚ÄúWhat is the best way for me to be on my own? Can I give up what I want to do, to do what needs to be done?‚Äù So many questions and self-doubt are hanging over him at the moment. ‚ÄúI can keep living the way I have been, or I can take responsibility for myself?‚Äù he tells himself. But he still feels scared, that come with great decisions like this. The path to becoming independent and finding out who he is; alwhile juggling work and college; is difficult he is determined to fulfill what needs to be set in motion.]", "subject": "title_generation", "answer": "1. \"Finding My Path: The Journey of Koa Runnels\"\n2. \"Breaking Free: Koa Runnels' Quest for Independence\"\n3. \"Sketching Out a Future: The Evolution of Koa Runnels\""}
{"question": "Create a perfect title headline about these articles Apple partner Foxconn Tech plans $700 million India plant in shift from China\nApple Inc. partner Foxconn Technology Group plans to invest about $700 million on a new plant in India to ramp up local production, people familiar with the matter said, underscoring an accelerating shift of manufacturing away from China as Washington-Beijing tensions grow.\n\nThe Taiwanese company, also known for its flagship unit Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., plans to build the plant to make iPhone parts on a 300-acre site close to the airport in Bengaluru, the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the information is not public. The factory may also assemble Apple‚Äôs handsets, some of the people said, and Foxconn may also use the site to produce some parts for its nascent electric vehicle business.\n\nThe investment is one of Foxconn‚Äôs biggest single outlays to date in India and underscores how China‚Äôs at risk of losing its status as the world‚Äôs largest producer of consumer electronics. Apple and other US brands are leaning on their Chinese-based suppliers to explore alternative locations such as India and Vietnam. It‚Äôs a rethink of the global supply chain that‚Äôs accelerated during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine and could reshape the way global electronics are made.\nThe new production site in India is expected to create about 100,000 jobs, the people said. The company‚Äôs sprawling iPhone assembly complex in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou employs some 200,000 at the moment, although that number surges during peak production season.\n\nOutput at the Zhengzhou plant plunged ahead of the year-end holidays due to Covid-related disruptions, spurring Apple to re-examine its China-reliant supply chain. Foxconn‚Äôs decision is the latest move that suggests suppliers may move capacity out of China far faster than expected.\n\nThe plans could still change as Foxconn is in the process of finalizing investment and project details, the people said. It‚Äôs also unclear if the plant represents new capacity, or production that Foxconn is shifting from other sites such as its Chinese facilities.\n\nApple declined to comment. Hon Hai, whose Chairman Young Liu met India‚Äôs Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The Karnataka state government also did not immediately respond. Liu, who is on tour in India, has committed to another manufacturing project in the neighboring Telangana state.\nFoxconn‚Äôs decision would be a coup for Modi‚Äôs government, which sees an opportunity to close India‚Äôs tech gap with China as Western investors and corporations sour on Beijing‚Äôs crackdowns on the private sector.\n\nIndia has offered financial incentives to Apple suppliers such as Foxconn, which began making the latest generation of iPhones at a site in Tamil Nadu last year. Smaller rivals Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. have also ramped up in India, while suppliers such as Jabil Inc. have begun making components for AirPods locally.\n\niPhone maker Foxconn plans $700 million India plant in shift from China\nThe investment is one of Foxconn's biggest single outlays to date in India and underscores how China's at risk of losing its status as the world's largest producer of consumer electronics\n\nFoxconn is investing $700 million to develop another iPhone manufacturing plant in India\nApple manufacturer Foxconn is planning to invest about $700 million in a new plant in India to increase local production. The plant will be located near the airport in Bengaluru and will assemble the iPhone along with other Apple products. The investment represents a significant and accelerated shift of manufacturing away from China and is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs in India.\n\nFoxconn's new factory will be built on a 300 acre site close to Bengaluru's airport, which is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. The plant will manufacture parts of the iPhone, and even assemble the iPhone itself. Foxconn may also use the site to produce parts for its electric vehicle business.\n\nThe Taiwanese company's largest factory is currently located in the \"iPhone city\" of Zhengzhou district in China. However, the manufacturing output at the Zhengzhou plant plunged due to China's zero-COVID policy that resulted in the lockdown of the region for months. The factory employees more than 200,000 workers which were affected because of the lockdown. Foxconn's massive investment suggests that manufacturers are moving their capacity out of China far faster than previously anticipated.\nFoxconn's investment in India is one of its biggest till date and highlights the potential for China to lose its position as the world's leading producer of consumer electronics. U.S. brands like Apple are encouraging their suppliers based in China to consider other locations such as India and Vietnam.\n\nIndia is also grabbing the opportunity to position itself as a manufacturing country. The South Asian country has provided financial incentives to Apple suppliers such as Foxconn, which already manufactures the latest generation of iPhones at a site in Tamil Nadu. Other companies like Wistron, Pegatron, and more have also increased their presence in India and have begun manufacturing components for products like iPads, AirPods, MacBooks, and Apple chargers locally.", "subject": "title_generation", "answer": "Foxconn's $700 Million Investment: Shifting Apple Production from China to India"}

{"question": "Generate a title for the following paragraph:\n\nCoxsackieviruses are enteric viruses that frequently infect humans. To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques >100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wildtype CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with N63Y mutant CVB3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB3, likely because N63Y mutant CVB3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver. Our data reinforce the idea that culture-adapted laboratory virus strains can have reduced fitness in vivo. N63Y mutant CVB3 may be useful as a platform to understand viral adaptation and pathogenesis in animal studies. IMPORTANCE Coxsackieviruses frequently infect humans, and although many infections are mild or asymptomatic, there can be severe outcomes, including heart inflammation. Most studies with coxsackieviruses and other viruses use laboratory-adapted viral strains because of their efficient replication in cell culture. We used a cell culture-adapted strain of CVB3, Nancy, to examine viral replication and pathogenesis in orally inoculated mice. We found that mice shed viruses distinct from input viruses because they formed extremely large plaques in cell culture. We identified a single mutation, VP3 N63Y, that was sufficient for large-plaque formation. N63Y mutant viruses have reduced glycan binding and replication in cell culture; however, they have enhanced replication and virulence in mice. We are now using N63Y mutant CVB3 as an improved system for viral pathogenesis studies. Citation Wang Y, Pfeiffer JK. 2016.

{"question": "Can you generate possible titles for a youtube video about this story:\n\nMy husband went missing six months ago. Just... went out to work one day and never came home. It was a horrible shock to the whole neighbourhood, because things like that just didn't happen in our little slice of white-picket-fence suburbia. The police launched an investigation, and the neighbourhood watch sent out search parties, but no one ever found any evidence to indicate what had happened to him. Our families were devastated. Recently, the missing posters have been taken down or papered over. The updates from the police became less frequent and dwindled away. I accepted that, hard as it was to admit, my Rick wasn't coming back.\n\nUntil he did.\n\nA week ago, I was in the back garden watering my petunias when I heard the garden gate creak open. I jerked my head in that direction and- there he was. Exactly the same as he was the day he disappeared. Same windswept blond hair and bright blue eyes, same curl to his pink lips. I was in shock. Our families had mourned for him, and yet there he was, standing in our garden like he had just popped out for milk or something. When I asked where he had been, he said he didn't know. He couldn‚Äôt remember anything about the last six months.\n\nAll our family and friends are beside themselves with joy. They almost can't believe it. But that's just the thing: I don't believe it.\n\nLook, I understand how crazy this all sounds, I do. Our families would never believe me, and I can‚Äôt go to the police unless I want to end up in a straightjacket. But I just know that the man sleeping next to me isn't my husband. I don't know what to do. I know I should be happy, but I'm not. I'm terrified. I don‚Äôt know much about anything supernatural or paranormal, I don't even like watching horror movies. But something about this whole situation makes my skin crawl.\n\nJust let me explain why I'm so sure. Once I've done that, hopefully one of you will believe me, and you'll be able to tell me what to do.\n\nThe morning after \"Rick\" came home, I made him a cup of tea. When I handed it to him, he gave me the brightest smile. Then he took a sugar cube from the dish on the table and dropped it into the cup. Our house was in chaos with his return, and I was still in shock, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but its been replaying in my mind ever since. I know it doesn't sound very significant, but my husband never put sugar in his tea. He was always adamant that it ruined the taste, and he'd get so frustrated if I ever put sugar in his cup by accident. And yet, this man had sugar.\n\nThen it was the golf. A few days ago, when he was out visiting his mom, I recorded a golf tournament that was showing on the TV. It was one of Rick's favourite golfers that was competing, and he never missed it. Once, he even skipped out on an anniversary dinner just to watch a championship. Only, when he came home from his parents' and I told him what I'd done, he just seemed... unbothered? Like, he said thanks and everything, and then he asked if I wanted to get dinner. He didn't even watch it, and that‚Äôs just so out of character for him.\n\nThen one night I woke up around 2 a.m. to see Rick's face inches from mine just... looking at me with these blank eyes. I kinda gave this nervous laugh and asked \"Baby, what are you doing?\" And he didn't answer. For like a solid thirty seconds. He just stared, almost like he was looking right through me. Then he suddenly smiled and said, \"Sorry, honey. Sometimes I just can‚Äôt believe this is real\". Then he just rolled over and went to sleep. I didn‚Äôt get much sleep after that, myself.\n\nYesterday, about a week after he came home, the neighbourhood threw a street party to celebrate his return. Everyone from our street and the streets on either side turned up to see him and tell him how happy they are that he's alright. When he wasn't standing with his arm around my waist, he was milling around chatting amicably to each and every one of our neighbours, even the little kids. Jackson, our next-door neighbour Sally's toddler, wanted to play peek-a-boo, and Rick happily played along with a smile on his face. Now, my husband never did that. Rick always said he didn't like kids - that's why we never had any - and so he never wanted to play with any of the neighbourhood children. Especially not Jackson: Rick all but avoided him. Before he disappeared, I had started to suspect it was so I wouldn't see them together and notice the subtle but unmistakable similarities.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin, proverbially speaking, was Sally. Just this morning, she came knocking on our door. Her excuse was the tray of brownies she carried, but I think she just wanted to push her way into our morning so that she could see for herself what the situation was. After she left, I called her a nosy busybody. Rick laughed, kissed my head, and agreed with me. That was when I knew for sure that it couldn't really be him. Rick always used to get so mad whenever I insulted Sally, like I didn't have any right to hate her even though she'd been fucking my husband for years. But today there was none of that. He didn‚Äôt even try to defend her.\n\nI know what you must be thinking. If he was in an accident or something, he might‚Äôve had some kind of traumatic brain injury that caused him to forget some things about his life, maybe even change his personality. And that's a valid, reasonable explanation. I have no doubt it's what the police would tell me if I reported all this.\n\nBut you know why I'm dead certain that man isn't my husband? He doesn't have a scar. If he was really Rick, he'd have a scar on the side of his forehead shaped like the golf club I hit him with. But there's nothing. Not a mark. Honestly, I'm this close to going out tonight and digging up my petunias just to make sure he's still under there.\n\nI don't know what I'm sharing a bed with, but I know it's not my husband.

It said this helped \"increase the use of our screen time tools by 234%\".\n\nUsers of the platform have to be at least 13, and, as part of this new feature, anyone under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification with a \"recap of their screen time\".\n\nNo 'right amount' of screen time\nUsers affected will receive their new time limit passcode on a screen in their app as the changes take effect.\n\nAnyone who opts out of the new 60-minute restriction, but goes on to use the app for 100 minutes a day, will receive a prompt from TikTok to set their own screen time controls.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app will also be able to set screen time limits, as well as access a dashboard which would give a breakdown of app usage.\n\nCormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said the company had worked with researchers in developing the new limits.\n\n\"While there's no collectively endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the video app welcomed the screen time limit, but described it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform.\n\n'Crack cocaine of algorithms'\nImran Ahmed is a chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which recently published research showing TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\n\n\"TikTok has won the race for the hearts and minds of 14 to 24-year-olds in the United States and the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\n\"It is the crack cocaine of algorithms. It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they‚Äôll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature‚Äôs first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n‚ÄúWhile there‚Äôs no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,‚Äù said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the ‚ÄúTikTok for Younger Users‚Äù limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok‚Äôs customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user‚Äôs account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok‚Äôs screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new ‚ÄúMute Notifications‚Äù setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children‚Äôs accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it‚Äôs developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don‚Äôt want their children to watch. The company is working with ‚Äúparenting, youth, and civil society organizations‚Äù over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks.", "subject": "title_generation", "answer": "\"TikTok Introduces Mandatory 60-Minute Screen Time Limit for Users Under 18 to Foster Digital Wellness\""}
{"question": "Create a perfect headline title about these articles Alibaba Group Holding's chip unit T-Head and Alipay, the payment service under Alibaba's financial affiliate Ant Group, will release computing chips for secure payments based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture, the two entities said.\n\nThe development comes as Chinese companies continue to invest heavily in chips, in the wake of U.S. export restrictions targeting China's semiconductor sector.\n\nThe chip will be embedded in hardware devices and used to enhance mobile payments, which are popular in China via the use of QR codes, Alipay and T-Head said on Thursday.\n\nAn Alipay spokesperson gave no date for the release of the chips, but said it would be placed in commercially available hardware devices soon, adding that the chips would be produced in collaboration with other chip-design companies.\n\nT-Head, a unit under Alibaba's cloud computing division, first unveiled its Xuantie series of RISC-V-based core processors in 2019.\n\nAlibaba is one of several Chinese tech companies to pour research and development resources into RISC-V, an alternate chip architecture. The dominant architecture for most mobile computing chips is from UK-based Arm Ltd.\n\nThe open-source nature of RISC-V's design in theory makes it less susceptible to export restrictions.\n\nAlibaba unveiled the chip at an event, which the company said was its first \"Xuantie RISC-V Developer Ecosystem Conference\".\n\nRepresentatives from companies including Alphabet Inc, Intel Corp and Imagination Technologies were present at the event, Alibaba said in a press release.\n\nIn 2019, Washington imposed export restrictions on China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which threw the company's access to ARM designs in limbo.\n\nIn late 2022, the United States launched similar export restrictions on Chinese chip fabs and research labs.\nAgainst this backdrop, the enthusiasm for RISC-V in China has grown, with more and more Chinese companies joining consortiums for the architecture.\n\nAt Thursday's event, Ni Guangnan, a renowned computer scientist at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, described China as the \"backbone\" of RISC-V.\n\n\"China's chip industry and the entire chip ecosystem will increasingly focus on the RISC-V architecture,\" he said, according to media reports.\n\nT-Head, the chip development arm of Alibaba Group Holding, and Alipay, a payment service provider of Ant Group, will release payment terminal processors based on the RISC-V open architecture, it was announced today. Reuters.\n\nChinese companies continue to invest heavily in processor development despite US sanctions on the Chinese semiconductor industry. RISC-V chips will be built into terminals that work with QR codes for mobile payments, which are very popular in the country. An Alipay representative did not specify when the chips would be released, but noted that they will appear as part of finished devices ‚Äì the processors will be made in collaboration with other companies.\n\nAlibaba‚Äôs T-Head division introduced Xuantie processors based on the RISC-V architecture back in 2019. Alibaba is among Chinese companies investing resources in the development of open-architecture processors as an alternative to the commercial arm. RISC-V‚Äôs open license makes the architecture less prone to sanctions ‚Äì against the background of this, enthusiasm for alternative solutions is growing in China and more and more companies are interested in it.", "subject": "title_generation", "answer": "Alibaba Leads the Way: New RISC-V Chip for Secure Payments Despite US Sanctions"}
