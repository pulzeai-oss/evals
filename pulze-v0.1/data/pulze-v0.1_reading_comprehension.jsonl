{"question": "Read the passage below and answer thq question: What are the recommended daily intake amounts of calcium and vitamin D for adults up to age 50?\n\n Growing and maintaining healthy, strong bones is crucial.\n\nIt's estimated that you reach peak bone mass around age 30. But there's good news: You can play a significant role in your bone health. This may mean that you either slow down or prevent osteoporosis (a disease characterized by brittle and breaking bones).1\n\nLearn more about how you can strengthen your bones and what can help, including the foods you'll want to add to your diet.\n\nWhat Can You Do To Help Your Bone Health?\nExercise and physical activity can keep bones healthy from childhood through adulthood. Kids and teens should aim for an hour of physical activity daily, while adults need about two hours and 30 minutes each week.1 Ideally, you would mix in exercises that are:\n\nWeight-bearing (e.g., walking, running, dancing, team sports)\nStrength training (e.g., lifting free weights, body-weight regimens)\nNon-weight-bearing (e.g., cycling, swimming)\nYou may also like yoga, pilates, or tai chi to improve flexibility, core strength, and balance. Additionally, a diet full of calcium and vitamin D can help if you develop osteoporosis. Getting plenty of calcium and vitamin D may slow the disease and prevent fractures.1\nHow Are Calcium and Vitamin D Helpful in Strengthening Your Bones?\nCalcium is a mineral that supports your bone and teeth structure and hardness. About 98% of your body's calcium can be found in your bones. The rest of your body sort of uses your bones as a calcium bank.2\n\nVitamin D is found naturally in a few foods, including fish and mushrooms, but it's mainly found in fortified foods. Your body also produces it when your skin is in the sun. Vitamin D improves calcium absorption and bone growth and helps your muscles, nerves, and immune system.3\n\nYou want to make sure that you get enough of each nutrient to maintain healthy bones. Adults should aim to get the following recommended amounts of calcium and vitamin D:24\n\nAdults up to age 50: 1,000 milligrams of calcium and 600 international units of vitamin D\nAdults ages 51 to 70: 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 600 international units of vitamin D\nAdults aged 71 and older: 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 800 international units of vitamin D\nYou can meet your calcium and vitamin D requirements by trying these 11 foods for healthy bones.\n\nDairy Products\nDairy products—like milk, yogurt, and cheese—can be excellent sources of calcium to help strengthen your bones.\n\nMilk\nMilk has several nutrients—18 out of the 22 that are most important for human health, including calcium. It is also considered one of the richest sources of naturally occurring calcium. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, different types of milk contain various amounts of calcium. Some examples include:56\n\n1 cup of 1% milk: 305 milligrams of calcium\n1 cup of skim milk: 298 milligrams of calcium\n1 cup of buttermilk: 284 milligrams of calcium\nYogurt\nAnother good source of naturally occurring calcium is yogurt. Dairy-based fat-free and low-fat yogurts can provide between 30% and 45% of calcium's daily value. Specifically, 8 ounces of low or nonfat plain yogurt has 448-488 milligrams of calcium, while 8 ounces of non- or low-fat plain Greek yogurt has 250-261 milligrams of calcium.57\n\nYogurt also contains other nutrients, such as:\n\nVitamin D (in fortified versions)\nMagnesium\nVitamin B12\nRiboflavin\nIodine\nCheese\nYou may be happy to know cheese can be a calcium source that provides other minerals, vitamins, and protein. Each kind of cheese packs a different punch so let's break it down. The estimated calcium contents for the following cheeses are:910\n\n1/4 cup of diced Swiss cheese: 294 milligrams\n1/4 cup of nonfat shredded mozzarella cheese: 272 milligrams\n1/4 cup of diced, low-fat American cheese: 240 milligrams\n1/4 cup of diced cheddar cheese: 234 milligrams\n1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese: 213 milligrams\n1/2 cup of ricotta cheese: 337 milligrams\n4 ounces of cottage cheese: 125 milligrams\nAs much as you may want to eat cheese for its calcium, it's a good idea to eat it in moderation. Cheese can be high in salt and saturated fats—two things that can raise blood pressure and LDL cholesterol (aka the bad cholesterol).", "subject": "reading_comprehension", "answer": "The recommended daily intake of calcium and vitamin D for adults up to age 50 is 1,000 milligrams of calcium and 600 international units of vitamin D."}

What degrees can one get at a higher educational establishment?\n\n7. What is the structure of an institute or a university?\n\n8. How can you prove that education in Russia is going through a transitional period?\n\nAnswer these questions. they refer to this text:\nRussians have always shown a great concern for education. The right to education is stated in the Constitution of the educational Russian Federation. It is ensured by compulsory secondary schools, Vocational schools, and higher establishments. It is also ensured by the development of extra- mural and evening courses and the system of state scholarships and grants. Education in Russia is compulsory to the 9th form inclusive. The stages of compulsory schooling in Russia are: 2primary education for ages 6-7 to 9-10 inclusive; secondary education including intermediate school for ages 10-11 to 12-13 inclusive, and senior high school for ages 13-14 to 14-15 inclusive. If a pupil of a secondary school wishes to go on in higher education, he or she must stay at school for two more years. Primary and secondary school together comprise 11 years of studies. Every school has a \"core curriculum\" of academic subjects, such as Russian, literature, mathematics, history, a foreign language and others. Lyceums and gymnasiums offer programs giving a profound knowledge in some field of study. After finishing the 9th form one can go on to a vocational school which offers programmes of academic subjects and a programme of training in a technical field, or a profession. After finishing the 11th form of a secondary school, a lyceum or a gymnasium one can go on in higher education. All applicants must taken competitive examinations. Higher educational institutions, that is, institutes, academies or universities, offer a 5-year programme of academic subjects in a variety of fields, as well as a graduate course. If one finishes a graduate course and writes a thesis, he or she receives the candidate degree, corresponding to the master's degree, or the doctoral degree. Higher educational establishments are headed by Rectors. Prorectors are in charge of academic and scientific work. An institute or a university has a number of faculties, each specializing in a field of study. Faculties have specialized councils which confer candidate and doctoral degrees. The system of secondary and higher education in Russia is going through a transitional period. As a result of it Russia took part in the international reform of higher education and signed the Bologna Declaration in 2003. The main objectives of the reform are: to decentralize the higher education system, to develop a new financial mechanism, to give more academic freedoms to faculties and students, (to introduce two stages of education in higher institutions - Baccalaureate and Magistrate, to increase Russian higher education competitiveness on the world scale.
