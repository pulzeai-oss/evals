{"question": "Proof read the following paragraphs please.\n\nWhen it comes to Spatial Data Infrastructure, often times Local Governments rely on licensed paid software (usually it's expensive too!). Yes, it comes with its benefits and definitely worth it; particularly in having assurance, maintenance, and expertise knowledge. I don't dispute/contest these software.\n\nBut,... what about Local Governments with limited budget? They can not afford this paid license software. To some, such software is a luxury or even overkill. They need to make decision, yet they need these crucial infrastructure to build policy. The solution is open source software.\n\nA great example from Whanganui District (New Zealand) demonstrating the power of open source stack to deliver spatial data projects; and employing open standards in their stack.\n\nhttps://data.whanganui.govt.nz/documents/502/link\n\nThe government has their public repository here:\n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/Whanganui-District-Council/repositories\n\nI find this very exciting because by being transparent with their codes & adopting open standards, this means:\nThey can connect to international-global skill resources as developers \"speak\" the same language.

Imagine if every phone has their own USB port?\n\nall and all, happy to learn such practice for local government. (:", "subject": "text_correction", "answer": "When discussing Spatial Data Infrastructure, local governments often rely on licensed, paid software, which can be expensive. While it has its benefits, this software may not be feasible for governments with limited budgets. For those who require crucial infrastructure to establish policy, open-source software provides an excellent solution.\n\nA prime example is the Whanganui District in New Zealand. They have harnessed the power of open-source technology and open standards to develop their spatial data projects. By employing this approach, they have accessed a global talent pool of developers, who speak the same technical language. In need of any developments or fixes, they can post bounties to source solutions internationally. \n\nThis setup also facilitates community involvement. The software's transparency enables users to identify and submit vulnerabilities, while also proposing solutions. The development history is recorded in the Git Logs, providing an auditable trail.\n\nAdhering to open standards makes the data schema modular and adaptable. Using OSGEO and OGC standards means components can be easily swapped out, just like how USB-C has become a standard port for charging devices. Without such standards, every device would require a different connection, creating unnecessary complexity. \n\nI'm delighted to discover such progressive practices within local governments and their commitment to advancing infrastructure.\n\nAre there any changes you would like me to make?"}
{"question": "Correct the below content\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\n\nFrom a younger age I was captivated by the world of Science Fiction and its portrayal of artificial intelligence. It sparked my imagination and fuelled my curiosity about the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence and my passion and interest only grew stronger as I grew older. Rather than a fantasy I saw possibilities. However, it wasn’t until a 20 day study camp at the MS Swaminathan research Foundation, a leading institution that researches in sustainable development and environmental stability, led by the Main architect of green revolution in India, Dr MS Swaminathan, I became acutely aware of the urgent need to address the environmental challenges facing the world today. I resolved to combine my passion for AI with commitment to environmental sustainability, to dedicate my life to a pursuit that ensures a better future for our planet. My passion for the environment has been lifelong as the son of a farmer and I believe that AI and robotics have the potential to be powerful tools in addressing some of the most pressing environmental issues we face today. I am particularly interested in the development of agents that can aid in tasks such a monitoring and cleaning pollution, mitigating the impact of climate change and preserving biodiversity. Therefore, my ambition is to be an AI researcher in one of the world's best robotics and autonomous systems research facilities that aligns with my goals.\nAs AI was a new and emerging field in India in 2010 with limited specialised bachelor’s degree courses, I pursued a computer science degree which I completed with a distinction. However, despite my desire to further my education, I didn't have the resources to pursue a Master's in AI at that time. Hence, I joined IBM, where I had the opportunity to take up additional AI projects, hone my technical skills, and gain real-world experience in the field. I continued to learn as much as I could about reinforcement learning, and my project EXA(Expert Advice) was chosen as one of the top 10 projects in the IBM Cognitive Build contest associated with IBM Watson. My focus became clearer and more defined, so I quit my job at IBM to fully concentrate on deep learning, as I was only doing AI partially. My shear perseverance, tenacity and months of hard work enabled be to land a job in Quinnox as full-time AI engineer. I was able to ideate, create and deploy more than 30 deep learning models in production involving computer vision, NLP and Reinforcement learning during the past five years. In 2021, I was granted a patent for one of the AI algorithms I developed (US11205041B2), which was a catalyst in believing in my ability to create unique and innovative solutions. Even though I was promoted and well-paid (as per Indian standards), my objective became more refined when I was developing an autonomous agent, Rover, for my recent project. I realized that multi-agent and multimodal reinforcement learning interests me the most and would help me achieve my dream of creating autonomous agents that can help maintain a sustainable planet. \nNow I am at crossroads in my life and career. I look around and find that I have more resources and opportunities than I first started. So I owe it to myself and my younger self to pursue this next step that will take me closer to the goal. After my masters, I would like to pursue a PhD to focus solely on the field and to be eligible to become the AI researcher in one of the top research centres for Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I have been following research and publications in multi-agent and multimodal reinforcement learning. During my research, I came across the work of Dr. Stefano V. Aldrich from the University of Edinburgh. I was intrigued by his research because it aligns perfectly with what I want to do in AI. Even though Master’s in AI is available in India the reason behind my aspiration to join MSc in AI at University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics is that, I believe as a global leader in robotics and autonomous systems, the University offers state-of-the-art facilities and a rich intellectual environment that will assist me in becoming an expert in AI. Moreover, the program will provide me with opportunities to collaborate with world-class researchers and like-minded peers, and to publish papers in top AI conferences.\nIn addition to my strong academic background and extensive practical experience, I also have a growth mindset and I am a continuous learner. I have made several contributions to open-source software and I am maintaining a blog where I share my knowledge with the developer community. I give back to the developer community with my skills in Python, Pytorch and Tensorflow and my answers in stack overflow had reached more than 1.4 million people worldwide. As an IEEE and ACM volunteer, I was able to host and participate in many events associated with the same. My contributions in my current organisation have taken ideas to fully fledged products used by dozens of clients. I am a Python and PyTorch verified expert as certified by Pluralsight, and I also have experience in Android apps using Flutter. During my personal time, I use reinforcement learning to automate games like Asphalt and Super Mario Bros. I have more than 8 years of hands on experience in developing AI solutions. For instance, I have recently developed a multimodal RL agent that can navigate through apps on its own taking visual and textual inputs. To pursue my goals I have worked on a variety of projects related to AI and Environment. For example I developed a deep learning model that can detect plastic waste from aerial images with an accuracy above 85% and a model that can detect forest fires early using satellite imagery and ground sensor data. I have also explored the use of RL in developing algorithms for controlling autonomous vehicles that can help cleaning up pollution.\nI believe that my unique combination of academic background, practical experience, and passion for AI and environmental sustainability will make me a strong candidate for the MSc in AI program at the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics.

In the traditional paradigm, the models are pretrained on custom domain corpus and finetuned on specific tasks, which make them very expensive for gpus and workers. What is worse, recent trends in language modeling is focusing on increasing performance through scaling with a booming cost.\n\nWe propose a simple and efficient pretraining framework GUR that unifies the language modeling and contrastive learning tasks in one pretraining step. Based on the examples of similar text pairs chosen by their LCS (longest common string) from raw unlabeled documents, our pretraining scheme consists of masked language modeling combined with a unsupervised contrastive learning task. The resulting model GUR performs surprisingly well without any labeled training datapoints. Specifically, it significantly outperforms all other pretrained baselines as a retriever at the recall benchmark in a zero-shot setting, and is competitive with BM25, a strong sparse baseline. Of course, the GUR keeps the ability of language modeling in our ablation experiment.\n\n", "subject": "text_correction", "answer": "Here is the edited version:\n\nRecent pretrain works have captured the spotlight, demonstrating remarkable success in NLU, NLG, and text representation tasks. The conventional approach involves training models on domain-specific corpora and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, which proves to be costly in terms of GPU usage and computational time. This trend of scaling up language modeling comes at a booming expense.\n\nWe introduce a revolutionary pretraining framework called GUR, which seamlessly integrates language modeling and contrastive learning into a single pretraining step. Our method selects text pairs with the longest common string from unlabeled documents. This approach serves as the foundation for masked language modeling and an unsupervised contrastive learning task. Remarkably, GUR excels without requiring any labeled training data, achieving outstanding performance. \n\nGUR stands out as a zero-shot retriever, outperforming all other pretrained baselines at the recall benchmark and giving BM25, a robust sparse baseline, a run for its money.
