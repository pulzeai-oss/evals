{"question": "### Question: A particle of mass m and charge Q and velocity V is directed toward a uniform electric field of strength E and travels a distance d. How far does the particle travel if the original velocity is doubled and the mass is cut in half? ### Choices: 0) 4d 1) 2d 2) d 3) 1/2d", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "Answer: 2d\n\nExplanation: In a uniform opposing electric field, the stopping distance is d = v^2/(2a) with a = QE/m, so d = m v^2/(2QE). With v → 2V and m → m/2, the new distance is d' = (m/2)(2V)^2/(2QE) = 2d.
