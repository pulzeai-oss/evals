{"question": "### Question: Bariatric surgery is used for obesity treatment but how much is the incidence of type 2 diabetes reduced in obese individuals after surgery?\n ### Choices: 0) 80-90% 1) No reduction in the incidence 2) Approximately 50 % 3) None of the options given is correct", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning process starts by clarifying the question, which focuses on the reduction in incidence—meaning new cases—of type 2 diabetes among obese individuals following bariatric surgery, such as gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Bariatric surgery is known to promote substantial weight loss and metabolic improvements, directly impacting diabetes risk.\n\nNext, relevant evidence from clinical studies is considered. The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, a key longitudinal trial, demonstrated that bariatric surgery reduced the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes to 7% in the surgery group over 15 years, compared to 28% in the non-surgical control group. This represents a relative risk reduction of approximately 75%, calculated as (28% - 7%) / 28%.\n\nFurther, meta-analyses and other research indicate that the reduction in incidence can reach 80-90% in obese individuals without pre-existing diabetes, due to factors like improved insulin sensitivity and weight loss. This aligns with the provided choice of 80-90%, which is supported by these findings.\n\nThe other options are evaluated: \"No reduction\" is incorrect based on the evidence; \"Approximately 50%\" underestimates the reported reductions; and \"None of the options given is correct\" does not apply, as 80-90% fits the data.\n\nThus, the choice of 80-90% is selected as the most accurate based on established medical literature.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:25:04.907981+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "64e2b983-1d9a-41b3-9f06-541ef5bff94b", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "2b0461e7-d69f-4421-90d6-b040c820b850", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
