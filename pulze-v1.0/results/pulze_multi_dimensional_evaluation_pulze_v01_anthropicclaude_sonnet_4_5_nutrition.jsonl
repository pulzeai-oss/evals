{"question": "### Question: Bariatric surgery is used for obesity treatment but how much is the incidence of type 2 diabetes reduced in obese individuals after surgery?\n ### Choices: 0) 80-90% 1) No reduction in the incidence 2) Approximately 50 % 3) None of the options given is correct", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "<think>\nThis question asks about the reduction in incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals after bariatric surgery.\n\nLet me think about what we know about bariatric surgery and diabetes:\n\n1. Bariatric surgery has been shown to have dramatic effects on type 2 diabetes in obese patients\n2. Multiple studies have demonstrated that bariatric surgery can lead to diabetes remission or prevention\n3. The question specifically asks about \"incidence\" which refers to new cases - so this is about prevention of diabetes in those who don't yet have it\n\nKey studies and evidence:\n- The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study showed that bariatric surgery reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes by approximately 78-83% compared to conventional treatment\n- Other studies have shown similar results with reduction in diabetes incidence ranging from 70-90%\n- For diabetes remission (in those who already have diabetes), rates are even higher, often 60-80% or more depending on the procedure\n\nLooking at the options:\n0) 80-90% - This aligns well with the major studies showing reduction in diabetes incidence\n1) No reduction - This is clearly incorrect as there is strong evidence of benefit\n2) Approximately 50% - This underestimates the benefit\n3) None of the options given is correct - This would only be correct if option 0 was wrong\n\nThe most accurate answer based on the literature, particularly the SOS study and meta-analyses, is that bariatric surgery reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes by approximately 80-90%.\n</think>\n\n### Answer: 0) 80-90%\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nBariatric surgery has a profound effect on preventing type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. Major evidence includes:\n\n**Key Evidence:**\n- **Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) Study**: Demonstrated that bariatric surgery reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes by approximately **78-83%** compared to conventional treatment over long-term follow-up\n- Meta-analyses consistently show diabetes incidence reduction in the range of **70-90%**\n\n**Mechanisms:**\n1. Significant weight loss\n2. Hormonal changes (GLP-1, ghrelin, PYY)\n3. Improved insulin sensitivity\n4. Changes in gut microbiome\n5. Reduced inflammation\n\n**Additional Benefits:**\n- For patients who already have diabetes, remission rates are 60-80% or higher\n- Benefits are seen across different surgical procedures (gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, etc.)\n- Effects can be sustained long-term with appropriate follow-up\n\nThe **80-90% reduction** in diabetes incidence represents one of the most significant benefits of bariatric surgery and is a major reason why it's considered an effective treatment for severe obesity, particularly in patients at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:23:15.093920+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "74c88880-05ed-47d6-9f4c-083d35c198e5", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "2b0461e7-d69f-4421-90d6-b040c820b850", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
