When the arm is above the level of the heart, the blood in the arteries of the arm is effectively \"uphill\" from the heart.\n*   **Effect on Measurement:** The pressure measured at a point above the heart will be lower than the actual pressure at heart level because the heart has to pump against gravity to reach that higher point. The pressure measured by the cuff will reflect this reduced pressure.\n*   **Result:** Therefore, if the arm is above the heart, the measured blood pressure will be lower than the true blood pressure at heart level, leading to an **underestimation** of the blood pressure.\n\nConversely, if the arm is below the level of the heart, the measured blood pressure would be overestimated.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:34:21.823342+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "4a311f12-a3df-426b-bab6-9b303f3dcf48", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "07be2d89-8e28-48fc-a51e-1f8366ae15eb", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Its *presence* is normal. Its *obliteration* or *absence* (e.g., due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or malignancy) can be an adverse finding. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n*   **Choice 1) Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour.**\n    *   Impacted faeces can form a hard, irregular, and sometimes fixed mass in the rectum. On digital rectal examination, such a mass can indeed be mistaken for a rectal tumour, especially if the examiner is inexperienced or if the faecal mass is particularly firm and adherent. This is a recognized clinical scenario. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n*   **Choice 2) A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless.**\n    *   A thrombosed external haemorrhoid is typically *extremely painful* due to the acute distension of the highly innervated perianal skin by the blood clot. Thrombosed internal haemorrhoids, especially if prolapsed, can also be very painful. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n*   **Choice 3) Peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy.**\n    *   Peri-anal warts (condyloma acuminata) are located *around* the anus and are often visible on external inspection of the perianal region.

{"question": "### Question: The maximum sustainable power: ### Choices: 0) usually remains constant during a race. 1) declines with the distance of the race. 2) is improved by a high fat diet. 3) is inversely related to muscle glycogen content.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "The question asks about \"maximum sustainable power\" in the context of exercise physiology. Let's analyze each choice:\n\n1.  **0) usually remains constant during a race.**\n    This is incorrect. While an athlete might try to maintain a steady pace, the *ability* to sustain a given power output can decline over the course of a long race due to fatigue, glycogen depletion, and other factors. Also, actual power output often fluctuates during a race (e.g., surges, hills).\n\n2.  **1) declines with the distance of the race.**\n    This is correct. The longer the distance (or duration) of an event, the lower the average power output an athlete can sustain. For example, the power output for a 1-minute effort is much higher than for a 1-hour effort, which in turn is higher than for a 4-hour effort. This is because different energy systems dominate at different durations, and fuel availability (especially glycogen) becomes a limiting factor for longer durations.\n\n3.  **2) is improved by a high fat diet.**\n    This is generally incorrect for \"maximum sustainable power,\" especially at higher intensities. While high-fat diets can increase fat oxidation and spare glycogen, they often impair the body's ability to utilize carbohydrates efficiently, which are crucial for high-intensity power output. Maximum sustainable power, particularly around or above the lactate threshold, relies heavily on carbohydrate metabolism. High-carbohydrate diets or periodized carbohydrate strategies are typically more effective for maximizing high-intensity endurance performance.\n\n4.  **3) is inversely related to muscle glycogen content.**\n    This is incorrect. Muscle glycogen is a primary fuel source for moderate to high-intensity exercise. *Higher* muscle glycogen content allows for *greater* sustainable power and longer duration of exercise. Conversely, low muscle glycogen leads to reduced power output and premature fatigue. Therefore, maximum sustainable power is *directly* related to muscle glycogen content, not inversely.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:18:51.557934+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "6ce39aa1-6b2c-46b9-9022-9eebd14befab", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "ce8bcb35-adf9-4ced-becf-d206b16bcc0b", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Bleeding from haemorrhoids is typically bright red blood (hematochezia) because it originates from the lower rectum/anus and is fresh. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n*   **Choice 1) Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids**\n    *   During pregnancy, increased intra-abdominal pressure from the growing uterus, hormonal changes (progesterone causing relaxation of blood vessel walls), increased blood volume, and common constipation leading to straining all contribute to the development or worsening of haemorrhoids. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\n*   **Choice 2) Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is associated with pain**\n    *   First-degree haemorrhoids are internal haemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapse. Internal haemorrhoids are typically painless because the anal canal above the dentate line has visceral innervation, which is not sensitive to pain in the same way as somatic innervation. Pain is usually associated with thrombosed external haemorrhoids or prolapsed/strangulated internal haemorrhoids. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n*   **Choice 3) Second degree haemorrhoids cannot be returned to the anal canal**\n    *   Second-degree haemorrhoids prolapse during defecation but reduce spontaneously. Third-degree haemorrhoids require manual reduction, and fourth-degree haemorrhoids cannot be manually reduced. Since second-degree haemorrhoids reduce spontaneously, they *can* be returned to the anal canal (they do so on their own).

While dehydration can occur, the primary description of \"blood volume loss\" often leads to isotonic dehydration (loss of water and electrolytes in proportion) or even hyponatraemia if hypotonic fluids are administered. Hypernatraemia in burns can occur due to extreme evaporative water losses, but the most direct cause of hypernatraemic dehydration is a relative water deficit.\n*   **3) blood volume is lost due to surgery.** Similar to trauma, blood loss during surgery primarily causes hypovolaemia and often isotonic dehydration, not specifically hypernatraemic dehydration as the primary mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the underlying cause of hypernatraemic dehydration among the given choices is insufficient water intake.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:31:03.433621+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "9e9b9f23-52a5-4925-918f-481dde1365ba", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "3e006baa-76ad-4611-9750-08c27760be94", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
