His most determined efforts to eliminate other gods were directed at the powerful state cult of **Amun**, who had become the chief god of the Egyptian pantheon during the New Kingdom. Mut, as Amun's consort and part of the influential Theban Triad (Amun, Mut, and Khonsu), was also a primary target of this suppression.\n\nAkhenaten changed his name from Amenhotep IV (meaning \"Amun is content\") to Akhenaten (\"Effective for Aten\"), moved the capital from Thebes to Akhetaten, and systematically defaced the names and images of Amun and other traditional gods on monuments throughout Egypt.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **2) Amun and Mut**.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:30:16.652807+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "e073f5e9-c556-4a15-8272-8e2d16507c2b", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "d4a9d725-8c45-4aaf-9be1-aa662fabf2e4", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
