Selenocysteine is often referred to as the \"21st amino acid\" because it is co-translationally inserted into proteins at specific UGA codons, which normally act as stop codons. This insertion requires a specialized tRNA (tRNA[Ser]Sec) and a specific mRNA stem-loop structure called a SECIS element.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **Selenophosphate:** This is the activated form of selenium that serves as the precursor for selenocysteine synthesis, but it's not the form found *within* the protein.\n*   **Selenohistidine:** This is not a known selenium-containing amino acid found in human selenoproteins.\n*   **Selenate:** This is an inorganic form of selenium (SeO4^2-) found in the diet, but it needs to be metabolized and incorporated into selenocysteine before it can be part of a protein.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:50:19.610861+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "0d4d5bdb-4c47-473a-9420-27382d2606df", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "c38df89e-cc9d-441d-9e9b-b414e11f9e63", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: The supplementation of diet with which fat soluble vitamins has been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease?\n ### Choices: 0) Vitamin A and D 1) Vitamin A and K 2) Vitamin D and E 3) None of the above", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "The question asks which fat-soluble vitamins, when supplemented, have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD). Let's evaluate the evidence for each:\n\n*   **Vitamin A:** There is no strong evidence from clinical trials to suggest that vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. In fact, high doses can be toxic.\n*   **Vitamin D:** While observational studies have shown an association between low vitamin D levels and increased CVD risk, large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation have generally *not* demonstrated a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in the general population. For example, the VITAL trial, a large RCT, found no significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with vitamin D supplementation.\n*   **Vitamin E:** Early observational studies suggested a potential benefit, but large, well-designed randomized controlled trials have consistently shown that vitamin E supplementation does *not* reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and, in some cases, may even increase the risk of certain outcomes (e.g., hemorrhagic stroke). Major health organizations do not recommend vitamin E for CVD prevention.\n*   **Vitamin K:** Particularly vitamin K2, has shown promise in observational studies and some smaller intervention trials for its role in preventing arterial calcification, which is a risk factor for CVD. However, the evidence for *overall reduction in cardiovascular disease events* through vitamin K supplementation is still emerging and not yet considered definitive or robust enough to make a broad claim of \"reducing cardiovascular disease\" in the same way as established therapies.\n\nConsidering the current body of evidence, especially from large randomized controlled trials, none of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) have consistently and definitively been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease through supplementation in the general population.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is that none of the options provided have been conclusively shown to reduce cardiovascular disease through supplementation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:56:07.068521+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "c44896cd-b7c4-48fd-83ea-081afc0844e4", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "c2276b1c-266a-4377-b051-d37358be9688", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus, though it most commonly affects the terminal ileum and colon.\n*   **1) May lead to intestinal obstruction:** True. Chronic inflammation in Crohn's disease can lead to scarring and thickening of the bowel wall, forming strictures (narrowing) that can block the passage of food and waste, causing an obstruction.\n*   **2) Is best treated surgically:** False. While surgery is often necessary for complications (like strictures, fistulas, or abscesses) or when medical therapy fails, it is not a cure and the disease can recur. Medical management (anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, biologics) is the primary treatment to control inflammation.\n*   **3) Requires a gluten free diet:** False.
