This principle, often summarized as *pacta sunt servanda* (agreements must be kept), ensures that international commitments take precedence to maintain global order. It applies to both treaty-based obligations and customary international law. Courts like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) have upheld this in cases such as the *Nottebohm Case* (1955) and *LaGrand Case* (2001), rejecting domestic law excuses for treaty violations.

{"question": "### Question: What is the meaning of implied authorisation? ### Choices: 0) Presumption of Security Council approval of armed force when a State has been forewarned 1) Implicit authorisation on the basis of a specific number of votes by UNSC members 2) Presumption that all unlawful attacks will be subject to armed force by a resolution of the UNSC 3) In cases of repeated unlawful attacks the UNSC shall authorise neighbouring States to take whatever measures they deem necessary to rectify the situation", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "**Answer: 1**\n\n### Explanation\nIn international law, particularly under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, \"implied authorisation\" refers to the Security Council's implicit endorsement of actions (such as the use of force) through the passage of a resolution. This occurs when the resolution receives the required threshold of supportâ€”specifically, at least 9 affirmative votes out of 15 members, with no veto from the five permanent members (P5). While resolutions often use language like \"all necessary means\" for explicit clarity (e.g., UNSC Resolution 678 on Iraq in 1990), the authorisation is inherently implied by the voting process itself, as it demonstrates collective intent without needing unanimous explicit consent. This mechanism allows the Council to address threats to peace flexibly.\n\nThe other choices are incorrect:\n- **0**: No such presumption exists based solely on forewarning a state; actions must still align with self-defense (Article 51) or explicit/implied SC authorisation.\n- **2**: The SC does not presume armed force for *all* unlawful attacks; responses are case-specific and require a determination of threat under Article 39.\n- **3**: There is no automatic SC mandate for neighboring states in cases of repeated attacks; regional actions may fall under Chapter VIII but require explicit SC approval under Article 53.\n\nThis concept is debated in scholarship (e.g., in cases like the 1999 Kosovo intervention, where prior resolutions were interpreted as implying NATO's authority), but the voting basis remains central.
