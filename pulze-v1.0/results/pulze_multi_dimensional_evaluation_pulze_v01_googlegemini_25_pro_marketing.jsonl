{"question": "### Question:  This is where intermediaries are given exclusive rights to market the good or service within a defined 'territory', thus using a very limited number of intermediaries: ### Choices: 0) Exclusive. 1) Intensive. 2) Selective. 3) Direct.", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **0) Exclusive**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Exclusive Distribution:** This strategy involves severely limiting the number of intermediaries, often granting a single retailer or distributor the exclusive right to sell a product in a specific geographic region. This is common for luxury brands (like high-end cars or watches) where the manufacturer wants to maintain control over the brand image, service quality, and pricing.\n*   **Intensive Distribution:** This is the opposite, aiming to place a product in as many outlets as possible (e.g., candy, soft drinks).\n*   **Selective Distribution:** This is a middle ground, using more than one but fewer than all available intermediaries. It's common for products like electronics or home appliances.\n*   **Direct Distribution:** This involves selling directly to the consumer with no intermediaries at all (e.g., through a company's website).", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:50:08.116215+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "74a3309a-08bd-4583-8783-41fba5e7d7c2", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "283bd19c-1a5d-42f7-a99d-c6e38454a68f", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

{"question": "### Question:  When analysing consumer lifecycles, marketers look at consumers in differing stages of their life. Many models upon which these are based were developed in the 1960s. Since then a lot has changed in 'consumer lifecycles'. Which emerging trends should marketers take into consideration? ### Choices: 0) Fewer people are getting married. 1) People getting married at a later age. 2) More couples co-habiting. 3) All of the above.", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **3) All of the above.**\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe traditional family lifecycle models developed in the mid-20th century were based on a fairly linear and predictable path: young single, newly married, family with young children, family with older children, empty nesters, and so on.\n\nHowever, societal norms have changed dramatically since the 1960s. Marketers must now account for more diverse and fluid lifecycle paths. The trends listed are all crucial to this new understanding:\n\n*   **0) Fewer people are getting married:** This creates a larger and longer-lasting segment of single consumers who may have different spending priorities (e.g., travel, experiences, individual-focused products) than married couples.\n*   **1) People getting married at a later age:** This extends the \"young single\" or \"pre-family\" stage. Consumers in this stage are often more established in their careers, have higher disposable income, and make significant purchases (like homes or cars) before ever getting married.\n*   **2) More couples co-habiting:** This creates a household unit with purchasing patterns similar to a married couple (e.g., buying furniture, groceries, joint vacations) but without the formal milestone of marriage. This \"pre-married\" or \"non-married\" couple stage is a significant market segment that didn't prominently exist in older models.\n\nAll of these trends contribute to a less predictable and more fragmented consumer lifecycle, requiring marketers to move away from rigid, traditional models and adopt a more flexible approach to segmentation.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:44:35.447762+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "2d6c39d4-912a-40b6-aeb6-a7e9ac653ad5", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "ca275ada-6f8a-4baf-9944-1134c1286ad1", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
