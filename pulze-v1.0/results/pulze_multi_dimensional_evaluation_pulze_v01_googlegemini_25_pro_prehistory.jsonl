Archaeologists have found eagle talons with cut marks suggesting they were worn as pendants (like those from the Krapina site in Croatia) and perforated shells, some with pigment, that were likely strung together as jewelry (from sites in Spain like Cueva de los Aviones).\n\n*   **1) Neandertals buried their dead:** This is one of the most well-known aspects of Neandertal behavior. Sites like Shanidar Cave in Iraq and La Chapelle-aux-Saints and La Ferrassie in France contain skeletons that appear to have been intentionally placed in pits, providing strong evidence for deliberate burial.\n\n*   **2) Neandertals produced and used complex stone tools:** Neandertals are famous for their sophisticated tool-making tradition, known as the Mousterian industry. This involved the complex Levallois technique, where a stone core was carefully prepared to strike off a flake of a predetermined size and shape.

The Minoans rebuilt their palaces (like Knossos and Phaistos) on an even grander and more complex scale, ushering in their golden age.\n*   **The End (c. 3420 B.P. or 1470 B.C.E.):** The decline of the Minoan civilization was precipitated by the colossal volcanic eruption of Thera (modern-day Santorini). While the exact date is debated, it falls within this timeframe. The eruption caused devastating tsunamis, widespread ashfall that ruined crops, and disrupted the trade networks that were the lifeblood of the Minoan economy.

{"question": "### Question: Which of the following is not a hypothesis for why hominids walked on two legs? ### Choices: 0) it freed the hands to carry things 1) it allowed for braincase expansion 2) it expended less energy than quadrupedalism for going long distances 3) it allowed hominids to see greater distances", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **1) it allowed for braincase expansion**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Timeline:** The fossil record shows that hominids were walking on two legs (bipedalism) for millions of years *before* significant brain expansion (encephalization) occurred. For example, \"Lucy\" (*Australopithecus afarensis*) was fully bipedal around 3.2 million years ago but had a brain size similar to that of a modern chimpanzee. Major brain growth didn't begin until the emergence of the genus *Homo* around 2.5 million years ago. Therefore, brain expansion was a later consequence of hominid evolution, not a cause of bipedalism.\n\nThe other choices are all well-established hypotheses for the evolution of bipedalism:\n\n*   **0) it freed the hands to carry things:** This is a classic hypothesis. Freeing the hands allowed early hominids to carry food, tools, and infants, which would have been a significant survival advantage.\n*   **2) it expended less energy than quadrupedalism for going long distances:** As forests shrank and grasslands expanded, hominids needed to travel farther to find food. Studies suggest that bipedal walking is more energy-efficient for covering long distances than the knuckle-walking of our ape relatives.\n*   **3) it allowed hominids to see greater distances:** Standing upright on the savanna would have allowed hominids to see over tall grasses to spot predators or locate food sources from farther away.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:59:19.563058+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "5d79da6f-2f0b-4066-a7f7-f152ffc9e06c", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "cc9f6b47-19e4-4bd1-a186-e2fa31d1810a", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
