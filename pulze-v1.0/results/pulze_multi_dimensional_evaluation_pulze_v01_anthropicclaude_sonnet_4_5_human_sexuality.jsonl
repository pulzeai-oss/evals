This shift occurred particularly during and after the sexual revolution of the 1960s-70s. Survey data consistently shows that:\n- Fewer people view premarital sex as \"always wrong\"\n- More people accept premarital sex as normal behavior\n- This represents a liberalization or becoming MORE permissive\n\n**Extramarital Sex:**\nAttitudes toward extramarital sex (adultery/cheating) have remained consistently negative or have become even LESS accepting over the same period. Survey data shows:\n- The vast majority of people continue to view extramarital sex as wrong\n- If anything, disapproval has remained steady or increased slightly\n- There is strong consensus that extramarital sex violates relationship commitments\n- This represents either stability in disapproval or becoming LESS accepting\n\nSo the pattern is:\n- Premarital sex: become MORE permissive\n- Extramarital sex: become LESS accepting (or remained consistently unaccepted)\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Option 3 states \"become more permissive; become less accepting\"\n\nThis matches the documented trends.\n</think>\n\nThe answer is **(3) become more permissive; become less accepting**.\n\nOver the past several decades, there has been a clear liberalization of attitudes toward **premarital sex**. Beginning with the sexual revolution of the 1960s-70s and continuing through today, surveys consistently show increasing acceptance of sex before marriage, with fewer people viewing it as morally wrong.\n\nIn contrast, attitudes toward **extramarital sex** (adultery/infidelity) have remained consistently negative or become even less accepting. The vast majority of people across decades continue to view extramarital affairs as a serious violation of relationship commitments, with little to no trend toward greater acceptance.\n\nThis reflects a broader pattern where society has become more accepting of consensual sexual behavior between unmarried individuals while maintaining strong disapproval of behavior that violates relationship trust and commitments.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:26:49.241168+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "91613bce-c39a-44c8-8dae-d98b6a84e03a", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "d8d5e3bd-f9cb-446e-9029-6635e1624686", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
