This means that at position 235 in the protein, aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine.\n\n## Step ## ## Step 3: Match the broken-down notation to the given choices.\nGiven that \"Asp\" stands for aspartic acid and \"Phe\" stands for phenylalanine, \"Asp235Phe\" indicates that aspartic acid at position 235 has been replaced by phenylalanine.\n\n## Step ## ## Step 4: Select the correct interpretation from the choices provided.\nThe correct interpretation is that aspartic acid (Asp) has been replaced by phenylalanine (Phe) at position 235.

It is indeed a familial cancer syndrome.\n- Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is another genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to develop certain types of cancer, including renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastomas, and pheochromocytomas. It is a familial cancer syndrome.\n- Waardenburg syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by hearing loss, skin and hair pigmentation changes, and eye color changes. While it is a genetic condition, it is primarily associated with developmental abnormalities rather than being classified as a familial cancer syndrome.\n\n## Step 4: Determine which condition is not a familial cancer syndrome\nBased on the information:\n- Familial adenomatous polyposis, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome are all recognized as familial cancer syndromes due to their association with an increased risk of various cancers.\n- Waardenburg syndrome, on the other hand, is not primarily known as a cancer syndrome; it's associated with hearing loss and pigmentation abnormalities.\n\n## Step 5: Choose the correct answer\nGiven the information, Waardenburg syndrome is the condition that is not a familial cancer syndrome.\n\nThe best answer is 3.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:32:48.125954+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "06dd682a-0520-47f3-b2bb-d1ab00c4c2e9", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "578fafd9-19b1-4599-9e7c-f806a91d6c07", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: Which of the following conditions shows anticipation in paternal transmission? ### Choices: 0) Huntington disease 1) Marfan syndrome 2) Cystic fibrosis 3) Fragile X syndrome", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the concept of anticipation in genetics\nAnticipation refers to the phenomenon where the symptoms of a genetic disorder become apparent at an earlier age as the disorder is passed to subsequent generations. This is often associated with the expansion of unstable repeats in the genome.\n\n## Step 2: Review the conditions listed for anticipation\n- Huntington disease is known for anticipation, particularly due to the expansion of CAG repeats. However, the degree of anticipation can vary, and it's more commonly associated with paternal transmission because the CAG repeat expansion is more likely to occur during spermatogenesis.\n- Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene and is not typically associated with anticipation due to repeat expansions.\n- Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. While it is a genetic disorder, it is not typically associated with anticipation.\n- Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Anticipation is observed, but it is more commonly associated with maternal transmission because the expansion is more likely to occur during oogenesis.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the specific condition showing anticipation in paternal transmission\nHuntington disease is known to show anticipation, and this anticipation is more pronounced when the disease is transmitted by the father. This is because the expansion of the CAG repeat is more likely to occur during spermatogenesis, leading to an earlier onset in the offspring.\n\n## Step 4: Choose the condition that matches the criteria\nGiven the information, Huntington disease is the condition that shows anticipation, particularly with paternal transmission.\n\nThe best answer is 0.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:35:14.999786+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "328ac01a-dd46-438e-bcd1-0b383263564b", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "85bc5eae-8bed-4e67-a4fd-14035f805d74", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
