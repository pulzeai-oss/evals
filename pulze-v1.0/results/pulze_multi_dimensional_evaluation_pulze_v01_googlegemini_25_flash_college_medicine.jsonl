Let's break down their structure based on the given statements:\n\n*   **I. A ribose backbone:** Ribose is a five-carbon sugar that forms part of the backbone of RNA. Triacylglycerides do not contain ribose. Their backbone is a three-carbon alcohol. So, I is incorrect.\n*   **II. a glycerol backbone:** Triacylglycerides are formed from one molecule of glycerol (a three-carbon alcohol) and three molecules of fatty acids. Glycerol serves as the backbone. So, II is correct.\n*   **III. three phosphodiester linkages:** Phosphodiester linkages are found in nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and some phospholipids, connecting a phosphate group to two other molecules (like sugars or glycerol). Triacylglycerides do not contain phosphate groups and therefore do not have phosphodiester linkages. So, III is incorrect.\n*   **IV. three ester linkages:** Triacylglycerides are formed when the three hydroxyl (-OH) groups of glycerol react with the carboxyl (-COOH) groups of three fatty acids. This reaction forms three ester bonds (linkages) and releases three molecules of water. So, IV is correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements II and IV are correct.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{II and IV}}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:19:27.575738+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "d00eeaaa-cd73-4b12-b31c-5022518d8549", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "b9edf5d2-6846-4ed2-9169-422542068ee7", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Let's analyze each choice in the context of typical and concerning attachment behaviors:\n\n*   **0) Decreased exploration when the mother is out of the room.** This is a **normal and often healthy** response. A securely attached child uses their parent as a \"secure base\" for exploration. When the secure base leaves, it's natural for the child to feel less secure and thus decrease their exploration, possibly showing some distress. This is not a concerning sign.\n\n*   **1) Crying and returning to the mother upon return.** This is a classic sign of **secure attachment**. The child shows distress when the mother leaves (indicating they miss her and rely on her for comfort), and upon her return, they seek comfort, are easily soothed, and then typically return to play. This is a positive sign, not a concerning one.\n\n*   **2) Avoiding the mother upon return.** This is a hallmark sign of **insecure-avoidant attachment**. In this attachment style, the child shows little or no distress when the mother leaves and actively avoids or ignores her upon her return, not seeking comfort. This behavior is considered concerning as it suggests a lack of secure attachment and potential difficulties in the parent-child relationship.\n\n*   **3) Exploring the room before the mother leaves.** This is a **normal and healthy** behavior. A securely attached child feels comfortable enough with their parent present to explore their environment.

They do not inhibit ATP breakdown.\n*   **1) involve the addition or removal of a phosphate group.** Kinases specifically *add* a phosphate group to a substrate. While phosphatases *remove* a phosphate group, the core chemical modification performed by kinases involves a phosphate group. Therefore, this statement accurately describes the type of chemical group involved in kinase reactions (addition of a phosphate group).\n*   **2) involve the addition or removal of a ketone group.** Ketone groups are organic functional groups (C=O). Kinases are not involved in the addition or removal of ketone groups.\n*   **3) involve the addition or removal of an amino acid to a polypeptide chain.** This process is related to protein synthesis (addition) or degradation (removal), not kinase activity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of kinase reactions among the choices is that they involve the addition of a phosphate group.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:24:39.598315+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a717d442-c516-45e8-8686-4b2ea7ceedb3", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "89686919-be68-4e59-bfe9-f3819abce7e3", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Let's analyze the original and modified RNA sequences.\n\n**Original RNA sequence:**\n`GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUAACAGA…`\n\n**Modified RNA sequence:**\n`GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUACCAGA…`\n\nFirst, let's identify the difference between the two sequences. Comparing them base by base:\nOriginal: `GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUAA CAGA`\nModified: `GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUAC CAGA`\n\nThe difference is at the 25th nucleotide (counting from the beginning). In the original sequence, it's an `A`. In the modified sequence, it's a `C`.\n\nNext, we need to determine the reading frame and how this change affects the protein. Assuming translation starts at the first `AUG` codon (which codes for Methionine and serves as the start codon):\n\nLet's break down the sequences into codons starting from the `AUG` at position 7:\n\n**Original sequence codons (from AUG):**\n1.  `AUG` (Methionine - Start)\n2.  `GGA` (Glycine)\n3.  `AGC` (Serine)\n4.  `GCC` (Alanine)\n5.  `AGA` (Arginine)\n6.  `UAC` (Tyrosine)\n7.  `AGU` (Serine)\n8.  `AAC` (Asparagine)\n9.  `AGA` (Arginine)\n...\n\n**Modified sequence codons (from AUG):**\n1.  `AUG` (Methionine - Start)\n2.  `GGA` (Glycine)\n3.  `AGC` (Serine)\n4.  `GCC` (Alanine)\n5.  `AGA` (Arginine)\n6.  `UAC` (Tyrosine)\n7.  `AGU` (Serine)\n8.  `ACC` (Threonine)\n9.  `AGA` (Arginine)\n...\n\nThe change occurs in the 8th codon after the start codon.\n*   In the original sequence, the 8th codon is `AAC`, which codes for **Asparagine**.\n*   In the modified sequence, the 8th codon is `ACC`, which codes for **Threonine**.\n\nThis is a **missense mutation**, where a single nucleotide change results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given choices:\n\n*   **0) Absence of the protein:** This would occur if the start codon was mutated, a premature stop codon was introduced (nonsense mutation), or the mRNA was destabilized. Since this is a missense mutation, the protein will still be produced.\n*   **1) Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein:** A missense mutation changes one amino acid to another. This typically results in a protein of the same length (similar-sized) because no stop codon is introduced or removed, and no frameshift occurs. The protein in question is a transmembrane protein that facilitates potassium entry. Even a single amino acid change can significantly alter a protein's structure, folding, stability, or its ability to bind to ions or integrate into the membrane, leading to a loss or reduction of function (dysfunction). Asparagine and Threonine are both polar amino acids, but their side chains are different, which could impact the protein's function. This is a very likely outcome.\n*   **2) No change:** This would be a silent mutation (where the codon changes but still codes for the same amino acid). Here, `AAC` (Asparagine) is changed to `ACC` (Threonine), which are different amino acids. Therefore, there is a change.\n*   **3) Production of a larger, likely dysfunctional protein:** A larger protein would result from a mutation that removes a stop codon or introduces a frameshift that extends the reading frame. This is a point mutation within a codon, not a frameshift or stop codon removal. Thus, the protein size will not increase.\n\nBased on the analysis, the modification results in a missense mutation, changing one amino acid to another. This will produce a protein of the same length, but its function is likely to be impaired, especially for a critical protein like an ion channel.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.87, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:26:52.413695+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "4629adfa-1410-4124-a64d-bc451285b8f4", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "6fcd97da-373d-41c9-b9c4-681183bfd657", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 5, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 8}
