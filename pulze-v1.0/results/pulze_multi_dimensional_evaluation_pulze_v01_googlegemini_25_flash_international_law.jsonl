The prevailing view in international law is that these sources are of **equal authority**.\n\n*   **Conflict Resolution:** When conflicts arise between rules derived from different sources, they are generally resolved by applying principles such as:\n    *   **Lex specialis derogat legi generali:** Specific law overrides general law. (e.g., a specific treaty between two states might override a general customary rule for those two states).\n    *   **Lex posterior derogat legi priori:** Later law overrides earlier law. (e.g., a later treaty might supersede an earlier one, or a new customary rule might supersede an older one).\n    *   **Jus Cogens:** Peremptory norms of general international law (often customary in origin) are considered superior to all other norms and cannot be derogated from. However, *jus cogens* is about the *content* of the norm, not the *source type* itself having a higher rank.\n\nTherefore, a treaty does not inherently supersede custom, nor does custom inherently supersede treaties.

The UN Charter (Chapter VII) requires explicit authorization from the UNSC for the use of force, except in cases of self-defense under Article 51.\n\nHowever, if we are to interpret \"implied authorisation\" from the given choices, we need to look for a meaning that suggests a tacit or unstated approval, rather than an explicit resolution.\n\nLet's analyze the choices:\n\n*   **0) Presumption of Security Council approval of armed force when a State has been forewarned:** This option uses the term \"presumption of approval,\" which aligns with the idea of something being implied rather than explicitly stated. While the condition \"when a State has been forewarned\" is specific and might refer to a particular (and controversial) argument for implied authorization, the core idea of a \"presumption\" is the closest to \"implied.\" It suggests that the UNSC's actions or inactions, combined with other circumstances, lead to an assumption of approval.\n\n*   **1) Implicit authorisation on the basis of a specific number of votes by UNSC members:** This describes the process of an *explicit* resolution. If a resolution passes with the required votes, it is explicit authorization, not implied. If it fails, there is no authorization.\n\n*   **2) Presumption that all unlawful attacks will be subject to armed force by a resolution of the UNSC:** This is an incorrect general principle. The UNSC does not automatically authorize force for all unlawful attacks. Furthermore, \"by a resolution\" indicates explicit authorization.\n\n*   **3) In cases of repeated unlawful attacks the UNSC shall authorise neighbouring States to take whatever measures they deem necessary to rectify the situation:** The phrase \"the UNSC shall authorise\" clearly indicates an *explicit* act of authorization by the UNSC, not an implied one.\n\nGiven the options, choice 0 is the only one that uses language (\"presumption of approval\") that aligns with the idea of something being \"implied\" or tacitly understood, rather than explicitly stated or enacted through a formal resolution.
