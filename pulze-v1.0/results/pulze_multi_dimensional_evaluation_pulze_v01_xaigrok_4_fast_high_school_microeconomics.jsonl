{"question": "### Question: Every day Melanie spends her lunch money consuming apples, at $1 each, and oranges, at $2 each. At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility? ### Choices: 0) She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges. 1) She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. 2) She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. 3) She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "1\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning follows the economic principle of utility maximization, where a consumer allocates their budget to equalize the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good. For Melanie, apples cost $1 with a marginal utility of 12, yielding a marginal utility per dollar of 12 / 1 = 12. Oranges cost $2 with a marginal utility of 18, yielding 18 / 2 = 9. Since 12 > 9, apples provide more utility per dollar than oranges at the current consumption level. To reach equilibrium, Melanie should increase apple consumption, which decreases the marginal utility of apples, and decrease orange consumption, which increases the marginal utility of oranges, until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. This adjustment aligns with choice 1, as it specifically targets equalizing the marginal utility per dollar rather than equalizing marginal utilities alone.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:32:01.513883+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "510b1314-5bfe-49d0-a714-c2029e8834b6", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "fd95bbc6-4461-4544-b6e0-828ae2b994d1", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
