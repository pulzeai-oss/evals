This occurs because the initial spending generates income, which is then partially respent, creating a chain reaction of further economic activity. The size of the multiplier depends on factors like the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), calculated as 1 / (1 - MPC).", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:17:28.515115+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "3e21707b-ceb0-4306-a0a8-4f12ed23b2c0", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "8f58cf1f-48c2-4b1e-93d5-710c145482b3", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
