{"question": "### Question: The normal modes of a carbon dioxide molecule that are infrared-active include which of the following?\nI. Bending\nII. Symmetric stretching\nIII. Asymmetric stretching ### Choices: 0) I only 1) II only 2) III only 3) I and III only", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "Here's a step-by-step explanation to determine which vibrational modes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) are infrared-active.\n\n**Key Concept:** A vibrational mode is infrared (IR) active if and only if it causes a **change in the net dipole moment** of the molecule.\n\n**Molecule Structure:** Carbon dioxide (O=C=O) is a linear and symmetrical molecule. In its equilibrium state, the individual bond dipoles of the two C=O bonds are equal in magnitude and point in opposite directions. Therefore, they cancel each other out, and the molecule has a net dipole moment of zero.\n\nLet's analyze each vibrational mode:\n\n1.  **I. Bending:**\n    *   **Motion:** The oxygen atoms move up and down (or in and out of the page) relative to the central carbon atom, which moves in the opposite direction to keep the center of mass stationary. This causes the molecule to bend out of its linear shape.\n    *   **Dipole Moment Change:** As the molecule bends, it temporarily takes on a V-shape. The two C=O bond dipoles no longer point in opposite directions and no longer cancel out. This creates a temporary, oscillating net dipole moment perpendicular to the molecular axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the dipole moment changes (from zero to non-zero), the bending mode is **IR-active**. (There are two degenerate bending modes, and both are IR-active).\n\n2.  **II. Symmetric Stretching:**\n    *   **Motion:** Both oxygen atoms move away from the central carbon atom at the same time, and then both move towards it at the same time (O ← C → O).\n    *   **Dipole Moment Change:** Throughout this vibration, the molecule remains linear and symmetrical. The two C=O bond dipoles change in magnitude, but they remain equal and opposite at all times. They continue to cancel each other out perfectly. The net dipole moment remains zero throughout the entire vibration.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since there is no change in the net dipole moment, the symmetric stretching mode is **IR-inactive**. (It is, however, Raman-active).\n\n3.  **III. Asymmetric Stretching:**\n    *   **Motion:** One C=O bond stretches while the other C=O bond compresses simultaneously (O ← C ← O).\n    *   **Dipole Moment Change:** In this motion, one C=O bond becomes longer (and has a larger bond dipole) while the other becomes shorter (and has a smaller bond dipole). The two bond dipoles are no longer equal in magnitude, so they do not cancel out. This creates a temporary, oscillating net dipole moment along the molecular axis.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the dipole moment changes (from zero to non-zero), the asymmetric stretching mode is **IR-active**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Bending (I): **IR-active**\n*   Symmetric stretching (II): IR-inactive\n*   Asymmetric stretching (III): **IR-active**\n\nTherefore, the infrared-active modes are bending (I) and asymmetric stretching (III).\n\nThe correct choice is **3) I and III only**.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:17:01.644148+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "abda968f-bfc9-47cd-affb-3516cb876f6b", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "c9b5937c-863b-4f05-aea3-82c01e90b01e", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

This is an acid-base equilibrium:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ HPO₄²⁻ + H⁺\n\n2.  **Understand the NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The experiment is ³¹P NMR, which observes the phosphorus nucleus.\n    *   The chemical environment around the phosphorus atom is different in H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, so they have distinct chemical shifts (δ):\n        *   δ(H₂PO₄⁻) = 3.42 ppm\n        *   δ(HPO₄²⁻) = 5.82 ppm\n    *   The problem states that a *single line* is observed. This is a key piece of information. It means that the interconversion (exchange) between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ is happening very rapidly on the NMR timescale.\n    *   When there is fast exchange between two species, the NMR spectrometer doesn't see two separate signals. Instead, it sees a single signal at a chemical shift that is the *weighted average* of the individual chemical shifts.
