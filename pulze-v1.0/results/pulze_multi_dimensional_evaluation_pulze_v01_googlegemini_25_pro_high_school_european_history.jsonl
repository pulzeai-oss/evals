{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a speech by Vladimir I. Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928\nWhich of the following policies of Joseph Stalin was NOT used to correct the problem cited by Lenin above? ### Choices: 0) Collectivization 1) Persecution of the better-off peasants 2) The Berlin blockade 3) The five-year plans", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **2) The Berlin blockade**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **The Problem Cited by Lenin:** Lenin's speech from 1928 identifies a core problem for the Soviet Union: its economy was dangerously split between a desired socialist industry and a backward, small-scale peasant agricultural system. He argued that for the survival of the Soviet state and socialism, the country needed to rapidly industrialize and transform agriculture into a large-scale, modern, socialist system.\n\n*   **Stalin's Policies to Address the Problem:**\n    *   **0) Collectivization:** This was Stalin's direct, though brutal, answer to Lenin's call to \"place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production.\" It involved forcing millions of individual peasant households onto large, state-controlled farms.\n    *   **1) Persecution of the better-off peasants:** This policy, known as \"dekulakization,\" was an integral part of collectivization. The kulaks (wealthier peasants) were seen as a capitalist class and the main source of opposition to collectivization. By eliminating them, Stalin aimed to break resistance and seize their resources for the new collective farms.\n    *   **3) The five-year plans:** Starting in 1928, these were Stalin's master plans for achieving the \"fast rate of development of our industry\" that Lenin called for. They focused on rapid, heavy industrialization, financed in large part by the grain seized from the peasants during collectivization.\n\n*   **Why the Berlin Blockade is the correct answer:**\n    *   The **Berlin Blockade (1948-1949)** was a major event in the Cold War, a foreign policy action taken by Stalin nearly two decades after the policies of collectivization and the first five-year plans were initiated. It was about the post-WWII division of Germany and the struggle for influence between the USSR and the Western Allies. It had nothing to do with the internal Soviet economic problem of transforming agriculture and industry that Lenin described in his 1928 speech.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.993, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:10:57.351315+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "4eddd8d6-4f48-4f85-9b8e-49d896dfb509", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "3c21985f-58ec-454e-882f-eb4d8c5d4bb0", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nThe assumption by a government of the office of Reliever-general to the poor is necessarily forbidden by the principle that a government cannot rightly do anything more than protect. In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress … the state is … reversing its function. … To enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. … [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. …\nThe poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong … are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. … When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.\nHerbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Spencer was an advocate of which nineteenth-century political philosophy? ### Choices: 0) Conservatism 1) Anarchism 2) Liberalism 3) Socialism", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "This passage outlines the core tenets of Herbert Spencer's philosophy, which is a form of Social Darwinism applied to political and social theory. Let's break down the key ideas in the text and see which political philosophy they align with.\n\n1.  **Limited Government:** Spencer argues that the government's only legitimate function is to \"protect\" citizens and \"enforce the fundamental law.\" He explicitly states that providing poor relief (\"Reliever-general to the poor\") is \"forbidden\" and a \"reversing\" of the state's function. This call for a minimal state, or a \"night-watchman state,\" is a central idea.\n\n2.  **Individual Liberty:** The passage emphasizes that the government's role is to ensure \"every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.\" This is a classic statement of the harm principle, a cornerstone of 19th-century liberal thought.\n\n3.  **Laissez-Faire Economics and Rejection of Welfare:** Spencer is vehemently against government intervention to alleviate poverty or distress. He believes that poverty, starvation, and the \"shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong\" are natural and ultimately beneficial processes (\"decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence\"). This is a radical defense of a hands-off, *laissez-faire* approach to the economy and society.\n\nNow let's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **0) Conservatism:** While 19th-century conservatives were often wary of radical change and state expansion, their philosophy was typically rooted in tradition, established institutions (like the church and aristocracy), and a sense of paternalistic duty. They might support private or church-based charity, differing from Spencer's view that suffering is a beneficial, natural process.\n*   **1) Anarchism:** Anarchism calls for the complete abolition of the state. Spencer, however, believes in a minimal state with the crucial function of protecting individual freedom and enforcing laws. He is not an anarchist.\n*   **2) Liberalism:** In the context of the 19th century, this refers to **Classical Liberalism**. This philosophy championed individual rights, limited government, constitutionalism, and *laissez-faire* economics. Spencer's arguments for a minimal state focused solely on protecting liberty and his belief in a natural, competitive social order are extreme but clear expressions of 19th-century classical liberal principles. His Social Darwinism was used to provide a \"scientific\" justification for these ideals.\n*   **3) Socialism:** Socialism is the direct opposite of Spencer's views. Socialists advocate for government intervention to reduce inequality, provide for the welfare of the poor, and often call for collective ownership of the means of production. Spencer's entire argument is a refutation of these ideas.\n\nTherefore, Spencer's philosophy as described in the passage is a form of 19th-century **Liberalism**.\n\nThe correct answer is **2) Liberalism**.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.771, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:14:59.156807+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "ae4b62e2-d3db-4531-adc9-57ba9647ac70", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "62b9b053-9544-40ef-af70-b55f005aaf26", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 0, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 5}
{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following entries are in the diary of Napoleon Bonaparte.\nParis has a short memory. If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)\nIf the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799)\nThe presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal. (diary, 1801)\nMy power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)\nThe revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever. (diary, 1805)\nWhile Napoleon was often praised for implementing his Napoleonic Code and a meritocracy in the army, the domestic issue that he was most often criticized for was which of the following? ### Choices: 0) Placing his relatives on foreign thrones 1) Changing the criminal code of France 2) Financial mismanagement 3) Curtailment of citizens' rights", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "The provided diary entries reveal a great deal about Napoleon's views on power and governance. Let's analyze them in relation to the question.\n\n*   **1799 Entry:** \"If the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power.\" This shows a clear intent to control the media and suppress free speech.\n*   **1805 Entry:** \"...there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests... one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever.\" This is an even more explicit statement about eliminating political opposition and completely censoring the press.\n\nThese entries directly point to a policy of suppressing the rights of citizens, specifically the freedom of the press and the freedom of political expression. While he was praised for the Napoleonic Code which established legal equality (for men), he was widely criticized for creating an authoritarian police state that censored the press, spied on citizens, and eliminated political dissent.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **0) Placing his relatives on foreign thrones:** This was a major criticism, but it relates more to his foreign policy and dynastic ambitions rather than a purely domestic issue affecting the rights of French citizens at home.\n*   **1) Changing the criminal code of France:** The Napoleonic Code, which included the criminal code, is mentioned in the question as something he was *praised* for. While some aspects could be criticized, it was not the *main* point of criticism compared to his authoritarianism.\n*   **2) Financial mismanagement:** Napoleon is generally credited with reforming and stabilizing French finances by creating the Bank of France and improving tax collection. This was a strength, not a weakness, of his domestic policy.\n\nBased on the evidence in the diary entries and historical context, the most significant domestic criticism against Napoleon was his suppression of liberties.\n\n**3) Curtailment of citizens' rights**", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.993, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:19:06.010629+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "89c120c6-6ef9-43f4-8654-8d4e60f46379", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "d25d2bbd-9de4-4b91-ab80-ff78fa84b282", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\némile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe radical movement known as anarchism, alluded to in the first paragraph, had been related to all of the following EXCEPT ### Choices: 0) the International Workingman's Association 1) Pierre-Joseph Proudhon 2) the Congress of Vienna 3) the Paris Commune", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. It is often described as a stateless society, although several authors have defined it more specifically as an institution based on non-hierarchical or free associations. Anarchism considers the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.\n\nLet's analyze the choices in relation to anarchism:\n\n*   **0) the International Workingman's Association:** Also known as the First International (1864-1876), this was a major organization that brought together various radical groups. A significant conflict occurred within it between the state socialists, led by Karl Marx, and the anarchists, led by Mikhail Bakunin. This ideological clash eventually led to a split in the organization, with the anarchists being expelled. Therefore, the IWA is deeply connected to the history of anarchism.\n*   **1) Pierre-Joseph Proudhon:** A French philosopher and politician, Proudhon (1809-1865) was the first person to declare himself an \"anarchist.\" His work, particularly *What is Property?* (1840), laid much of the theoretical groundwork for the anarchist movement. He is considered one of the most influential early anarchist thinkers.\n*   **3) the Paris Commune:** This was a radical socialist and revolutionary government that ruled Paris in 1871. It included a significant number of anarchists and followers of Proudhon. Anarchists like Mikhail Bakunin and later Peter Kropotkin viewed the Commune as a key historical example of a proletarian revolution and a model for a future anarchist society, celebrating its decentralized and federalist structure.\n\nNow let's consider the remaining option:\n\n*   **2) the Congress of Vienna:** This was a conference of ambassadors of European states held in Vienna from 1814 to 1815. Its objective was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The Congress was dominated by conservative statesmen like Klemens von Metternich and aimed to restore traditional monarchies and suppress revolutionary movements like liberalism and nationalism. It was an effort to reinforce the power of the state and traditional hierarchies, which is the direct opposite of the goals of anarchism. Anarchism as a distinct political movement emerged later in the 19th century, in part as a reaction against the type of conservative state power that the Congress of Vienna sought to entrench.\n\nTherefore, the Congress of Vienna is the only option not related to the radical movement of anarchism.\n\nThe correct answer is **2) the Congress of Vienna**.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:22:20.168197+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "654874d4-50aa-4203-b8f4-7ed341a1d705", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "3797ddf8-c280-4adf-ad32-5ee7218ff907", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\n\"XI. As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&…\nXXXVI. We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments, namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to form an acquaintance with things.\"\nFrancis Bacon, English philosopher and essayist, Novum Organum, 1620\nBy the 1800s, the method of empirical reasoning reflected in the passage had undergone which of the following changes? ### Choices: 0) It had weakened to the point of irrelevance. 1) It had become a core principle of European culture. 2) It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it. 3) It had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "This question asks about the status of the empirical method, as described by Francis Bacon, by the 1800s.\n\n1.  **Analyze Bacon's Argument:** In the provided text from 1620, Bacon criticizes the old way of thinking (jumping from a few observations to grand, unproven theories) and advocates for a new method. This new method, which he calls the \"true but unattempted way,\" is what we now call the **inductive method** or **empiricism**. It involves:\n    *   Starting with specific, detailed observations (\"particulars\").\n    *   Slowly and gradually building up to broader generalizations (\"axioms\").\n    *   Rejecting preconceived notions and relying on direct experience with \"things.\"\n    *   This is the foundation of the modern scientific method.\n\n2.  **Trace the Historical Development:**\n    *   **The Scientific Revolution (1600s):** Bacon's ideas were hugely influential. Scientists like Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, and organizations like the Royal Society of London embraced this experimental, observation-based approach. This method led to massive breakthroughs in physics, astronomy, and chemistry.\n    *   **The Enlightenment (1700s):** Thinkers of the Enlightenment took the principles of the Scientific Revolution and applied them to society, government, and human nature. They believed that reason and empirical observation could be used to understand and improve all aspects of life. This worldview placed science and reason at the center of human progress.\n    *   **The 1800s:** By this century, the empirical method was not just a tool for scientists; it was a dominant force in European thought. The Industrial Revolution was fueled by scientific and technological advancements rooted in this method. Philosophies like Positivism argued that scientific knowledge was the only valid form of knowledge. The belief in progress, a hallmark of the 19th century, was largely based on the perceived power of science and reason to solve problems and improve the human condition.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Choices:**\n    *   **0) It had weakened to the point of irrelevance.** This is the opposite of what happened. The 1800s saw the prestige and influence of the scientific method at a high point.\n    *   **1) It had become a core principle of European culture.** This is the most accurate description. The scientific method, rooted in Bacon's empiricism, had moved beyond the laboratory to become a fundamental way of thinking that shaped philosophy, politics, industry, and the general belief in progress.\n    *   **2) It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable...** While the method was certainly refined, its core principles of observation, experimentation, and inductive reasoning would have been perfectly recognizable to Bacon. He would have seen the 19th century as a validation of his ideas, not a distortion of them.\n    *   **3) It had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle...** The method was seen as dynamic and progressive, not stagnant. While counter-movements like Romanticism existed, the dominant cultural trend was a deep faith in science and reason, not a rejection of it.\n\nTherefore, the method of empirical reasoning had become a central and foundational element of European culture by the 1800s.\n\nThe correct answer is **1) It had become a core principle of European culture.**", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:37:19.746568+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "4fd5d6ec-9da2-41a6-b62d-331648fc4d45", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "4ad049d9-580b-4f09-b42f-845799743974", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
