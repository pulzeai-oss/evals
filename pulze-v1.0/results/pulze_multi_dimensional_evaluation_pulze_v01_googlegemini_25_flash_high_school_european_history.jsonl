{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following entries are in the diary of Napoleon Bonaparte.\nParis has a short memory. If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)\nIf the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799)\nThe presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal. (diary, 1801)\nMy power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)\nThe revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever. (diary, 1805)\nWhile Napoleon was often praised for implementing his Napoleonic Code and a meritocracy in the army, the domestic issue that he was most often criticized for was which of the following? ### Choices: 0) Placing his relatives on foreign thrones 1) Changing the criminal code of France 2) Financial mismanagement 3) Curtailment of citizens' rights", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "The question asks about the domestic issue for which Napoleon was most often criticized. Let's analyze the provided diary entries and the choices.\n\nThe diary entries provide strong clues:\n*   **1799:** \"If the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power.\"\n*   **1805:** \"I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever.\"\n\nThese statements clearly indicate Napoleon's intention and practice of controlling the press and suppressing dissent, which are direct curtailments of citizens' rights, specifically freedom of speech and the press.\n\nNow let's evaluate the choices:\n*   **0) Placing his relatives on foreign thrones:** This was a significant criticism, but it was an *international* or *foreign policy* issue, not a *domestic* one. The question specifically asks for a *domestic* issue.\n*   **1) Changing the criminal code of France:** Napoleon's legal reforms, including the Napoleonic Code, are generally considered one of his most enduring and positive legacies, establishing legal equality and rationalizing the law. While specific aspects might have been debated, the Code itself was not his *most often criticized* domestic issue in a negative sense.\n*   **2) Financial mismanagement:** While Napoleon's wars were costly, and his regime faced financial challenges, financial mismanagement is not typically highlighted as his *most often criticized* domestic issue compared to his authoritarian tendencies. He did, in fact, stabilize the French economy after the revolutionary period.\n*   **3) Curtailment of citizens' rights:** The diary entries directly support this. Napoleon's regime was characterized by censorship, suppression of political opposition, the use of a secret police, and the overall concentration of power in his hands. These actions represent a significant curtailment of the freedoms and rights that had been proclaimed during the French Revolution. This is a widely recognized and frequently criticized aspect of his domestic rule.\n\nBased on the diary entries and historical context, the curtailment of citizens' rights, particularly freedom of the press and political expression, was a major and often criticized domestic issue during Napoleon's rule.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:30:34.312757+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "da0974c3-f0ae-4032-ad90-ff717b9e5597", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "d25d2bbd-9de4-4b91-ab80-ff78fa84b282", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a speech by Vladimir I. Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928\nWhich of the following policies of Joseph Stalin was NOT used to correct the problem cited by Lenin above? ### Choices: 0) Collectivization 1) Persecution of the better-off peasants 2) The Berlin blockade 3) The five-year plans", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The problem cited by Lenin in the excerpt is the need for rapid industrialization and the transformation of agriculture from a \"scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants\" to \"large-scale production\" to support industry and ensure the \"final victory of socialism.\" He warns that failure to do so could lead to a \"return to capitalism.\"\n\nLet's analyze each of Stalin's policies:\n\n*   **0) Collectivization:** This policy directly addressed Lenin's concern about the \"scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants.\" By consolidating individual farms into large collective farms, Stalin aimed to create large-scale agricultural production, increase efficiency, and extract resources to fund industrialization. This was a direct attempt to correct the problem.\n\n*   **1) Persecution of the better-off peasants (Kulaks):** The kulaks were seen as a class that resisted collectivization and embodied the \"small commodity economy\" that Lenin criticized. Their persecution (dekulakization) was an integral part of the collectivization drive, aimed at eliminating resistance to large-scale socialist agriculture and ensuring the success of the policy. This was a method used to implement the solution to the problem.\n\n*   **2) The Berlin blockade:** This was a major international crisis during the early Cold War (1948-1949), where the Soviet Union blocked Western Allies' access to West Berlin. This was a geopolitical maneuver related to post-World War II power struggles and the division of Germany, not an internal economic policy designed to address the issues of industrialization or agricultural transformation within the Soviet Union as described by Lenin in 1928.\n\n*   **3) The five-year plans:** These were a series of ambitious economic plans, starting in 1928, that aimed for rapid industrialization, particularly in heavy industry, and the collectivization of agriculture. This directly addressed Lenin's call for a \"fast rate of development of our industry\" and the transformation of agriculture to support it. This was a core policy used to correct the problem.\n\nTherefore, the Berlin blockade was NOT a policy used to correct the problem cited by Lenin.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:30:24.421313+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "df10c9a6-979a-47f2-98a2-86d544aff9f7", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "3c21985f-58ec-454e-882f-eb4d8c5d4bb0", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nThe assumption by a government of the office of Reliever-general to the poor is necessarily forbidden by the principle that a government cannot rightly do anything more than protect. In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress … the state is … reversing its function. … To enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. … [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. …\nThe poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong … are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. … When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.\nHerbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Spencer was an advocate of which nineteenth-century political philosophy? ### Choices: 0) Conservatism 1) Anarchism 2) Liberalism 3) Socialism", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The passage presents Herbert Spencer's views on the role of government and society. Let's break down his key arguments:\n\n1.  **Limited Government:** Spencer states that \"a government cannot rightly do anything more than protect.\" Its function is \"to enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.\" He explicitly rejects the government's role in \"mitigation of distress\" or demanding \"contributions for the mitigation of distress.\" This is a strong advocacy for a minimal state, often called a \"night-watchman state.\"\n\n2.  **Individual Responsibility and Laissez-faire:** He argues that the state should not be \"insuring him satisfaction.\" He views \"The poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong\" as \"decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence\" and \"full of the highest beneficence.\" This is the core idea of Social Darwinism, where natural selection is applied to human society, implying that intervention to help the less fortunate is detrimental to the overall progress of humanity.\n\nNow let's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **0) Conservatism:** While some conservatives might favor limited government, Spencer's radical individualism and rejection of any state welfare is not the defining characteristic of conservatism, which often emphasizes tradition, social order, and sometimes paternalistic state intervention.\n*   **1) Anarchism:** Anarchism advocates for the complete absence of government. Spencer clearly states the government has a legitimate, albeit limited, role: \"to protect\" and \"to enforce the fundamental law.\" Therefore, he is not an anarchist.\n*   **2) Liberalism:** Nineteenth-century liberalism, particularly classical liberalism, strongly emphasized individual liberty, limited government, free markets (laissez-faire), and individual responsibility. Spencer's ideas, especially his advocacy for minimal state intervention and the application of \"survival of the fittest\" to society (Social Darwinism), are a quintessential example of classical liberalism. His focus on individual freedom and the rejection of state welfare align perfectly with this philosophy.\n*   **3) Socialism:** Socialism advocates for greater state intervention or collective ownership of the means of production to achieve social and economic equality, and typically supports robust social welfare programs. Spencer's views are diametrically opposed to socialist principles, as he explicitly rejects state intervention for social welfare and sees individual suffering as a natural, even beneficial, process.\n\nBased on his arguments for minimal government, individual liberty, and the \"survival of the fittest\" in society, Spencer was a prominent advocate of **Liberalism** (specifically classical liberalism, which evolved into Social Darwinism).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:33:27.827039+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "74eea3ec-e34a-40c6-ab3b-4446494101b4", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "62b9b053-9544-40ef-af70-b55f005aaf26", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\némile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe radical movement known as anarchism, alluded to in the first paragraph, had been related to all of the following EXCEPT ### Choices: 0) the International Workingman's Association 1) Pierre-Joseph Proudhon 2) the Congress of Vienna 3) the Paris Commune", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The question asks to identify which of the given options is *NOT* related to anarchism. Let's analyze each choice:\n\n*   **0) the International Workingman's Association (First International):** This organization, founded in 1864, was a significant forum for various socialist and anarchist currents. Mikhail Bakunin, a prominent anarchist, was a key figure in the First International and famously clashed with Karl Marx over the role of the state, leading to a split. Therefore, anarchism is directly related to the First International.\n\n*   **1) Pierre-Joseph Proudhon:** Proudhon (1809-1865) is widely considered one of the first self-proclaimed anarchists and a foundational figure in anarchist thought. His ideas, particularly mutualism, are central to early anarchist theory. Therefore, anarchism is directly related to Proudhon.\n\n*   **2) the Congress of Vienna:** The Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) was a conference of European powers that aimed to restore the old monarchical order and balance of power after the Napoleonic Wars. It was a conservative effort to re-establish state authority and traditional hierarchies. Anarchism, by contrast, advocates for the abolition of the state and all forms of hierarchy. There is no historical connection or ideological alignment between the Congress of Vienna and anarchism; they represent opposing political philosophies.\n\n*   **3) the Paris Commune:** The Paris Commune (1871) was a radical, revolutionary government that briefly ruled Paris. While it encompassed various socialist and revolutionary tendencies, it was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas, and many anarchists participated in and supported it. It was seen by many anarchists as a practical example of a stateless, communal society, even if temporary. Therefore, anarchism is related to the Paris Commune.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Congress of Vienna is the only option that is not related to anarchism.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:32:35.253330+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "6995edb7-c9fc-402e-a536-d79a2f5227a4", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "3797ddf8-c280-4adf-ad32-5ee7218ff907", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\n\"XI. As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII.

This is a foundational description of **inductive reasoning** and the **empirical method**, which emphasizes observation, experimentation, and the systematic collection of data to build knowledge.\n\nBy the 1800s, the intellectual landscape of Europe had been profoundly shaped by the Scientific Revolution (17th century) and the Enlightenment (18th century). These movements championed reason, observation, and systematic inquiry as the primary means of understanding the world. The scientific method, which is heavily reliant on empirical reasoning, had become the dominant paradigm for scientific discovery and technological advancement.\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **0) It had weakened to the point of irrelevance.** This is incorrect. The 1800s were a period of immense scientific and technological progress (e.g., Darwin's theory of evolution, Maxwell's equations, the Industrial Revolution), all built upon empirical reasoning.\n*   **1) It had become a core principle of European culture.** This is the most accurate description. By the 1800s, the empirical method was not just \"attempted\" but widely adopted and highly successful. It was central to scientific inquiry, influenced philosophical thought, shaped educational practices, and drove technological innovation. It became a fundamental way of thinking and approaching problems across various fields, deeply embedded in the intellectual and practical life of Europe.\n*   **2) It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it.** While the scientific method certainly evolved and became more sophisticated (e.g., the development of more rigorous experimental design, statistical analysis, the hypothetico-deductive model), its core principles of observation, experimentation, and inductive reasoning (or empirical testing of hypotheses) remained. Bacon would likely recognize the fundamental approach, even if the specific tools and complexity had advanced significantly. \"Unrecognizable\" is too strong a claim.\n*   **3) It had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.** This is incorrect. Far from stagnating, empirical reasoning was seen as a dynamic and powerful engine of progress, leading to continuous discoveries and improvements in various aspects of life.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:43:04.591817+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "e452a27e-b277-4334-85d9-a8e106c858d1", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "4ad049d9-580b-4f09-b42f-845799743974", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
