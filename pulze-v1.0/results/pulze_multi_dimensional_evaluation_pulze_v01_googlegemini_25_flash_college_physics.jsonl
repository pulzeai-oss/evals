A key characteristic of reversible processes is related to entropy.\n\nLet's analyze each choice:\n\n*   **0) There are no changes in the internal energy of the system.**\n    *   This is not necessarily true. For example, a reversible adiabatic expansion causes the internal energy of the system to decrease as the system does work. A reversible isochoric process where heat is added will increase the internal energy. Only for specific cases (like a reversible isothermal process of an ideal gas) does internal energy remain constant.\n\n*   **1) The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.**\n    *   This describes an *isothermal* process. Not all reversible processes are isothermal. For instance, a reversible adiabatic process involves a change in temperature.\n\n*   **2) The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.**\n    *   According to the second law of thermodynamics, for any process, the change in entropy of the universe (system + environment) is $\\Delta S_{universe} = \\Delta S_{system} + \\Delta S_{environment}$.\n    *   For a reversible process, by definition, there is no net increase in entropy of the universe. Therefore, $\\Delta S_{universe} = 0$. This means that the total entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged. This statement is true.\n\n*   **3) The entropy of the system and its environment must increase.**\n    *   This describes an *irreversible* process, where $\\Delta S_{universe} > 0$. For a reversible process, $\\Delta S_{universe} = 0$.

Therefore, its horizontal velocity remains constant at 100 m/s due north.\n    *   **Vertical motion:** The payload starts with an initial vertical velocity of 0 m/s (since it was moving parallel to the ground).
