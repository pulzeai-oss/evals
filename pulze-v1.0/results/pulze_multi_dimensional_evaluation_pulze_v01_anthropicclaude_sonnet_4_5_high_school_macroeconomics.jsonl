This is a specific type of multiplier effect, but it's not the general term for when aggregate demand increases lead to larger increases in GDP.\n\n1) **The money multiplier** - This refers to how banks create money through the lending process - how an initial deposit can lead to a larger increase in the money supply. This is about money creation, not the relationship between aggregate demand and real GDP.\n\n2) **The foreign substitution effect** - This relates to how changes in relative prices affect the demand for domestic versus foreign goods. This isn't about the multiplier effect on GDP.\n\n3) **The spending multiplier** - This is the concept that describes how an initial change in spending (which shifts aggregate demand) leads to a larger change in real GDP. For example, if the multiplier is 2, then a $100 increase in spending leads to a $200 increase in GDP.\n\nThe spending multiplier (also called the expenditure multiplier or fiscal multiplier) is the fundamental concept that explains why changes in aggregate demand result in proportionally larger changes in real GDP. This occurs because initial spending creates income for others, who then spend part of that income, creating more income, and so on.\n\nThe answer is **3) the spending multiplier**.\n</think>\n\nWhen a large increase in aggregate demand results in an even greater increase in real GDP, this phenomenon is called **the spending multiplier** (option 3).\n\nThe spending multiplier explains how an initial change in spending ripples through the economy:\n- An initial increase in spending (consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports) shifts aggregate demand\n- This creates income for workers and businesses\n- They spend a portion of that new income (based on the marginal propensity to consume)\n- This additional spending creates more income for others\n- The cycle continues, resulting in a total change in GDP that is larger than the initial spending change\n\n**Formula**: Multiplier = 1/(1-MPC) or 1/MPS\n\nFor example, if MPC = 0.8, the multiplier = 5, meaning a $100 increase in spending ultimately increases GDP by $500.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n- **Balanced budget multiplier**: Specific to equal changes in government spending and taxes\n- **Money multiplier**: Relates to bank lending and money supply, not GDP changes\n- **Foreign substitution effect**: Concerns relative price changes affecting imports/exports\n\n**The answer is 3) the spending multiplier.**", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.97, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:18:17.642288+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a0fee300-de85-4e5a-9555-692769ab0d49", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "8f58cf1f-48c2-4b1e-93d5-710c145482b3", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
