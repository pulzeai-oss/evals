{"question": "### Question: A colleague, a licensed psychologist, confides in you that he has just ended a sexual relationship with one of his clients. As he describes the client, you realize that she is someone you referred to him about 18 months ago. As an ethical psychologist, you should: ### Choices: 0) file a complaint against the colleague immediately with the Ethics Committee. 1) file a complaint against the colleague with the Ethics Committee after informing him that you intend to do so. 2) discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take. 3) contact the client and discuss the matter with her.", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "2) discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take.\n\nRationale: Under APA Ethics Code (Informal Resolution), the first step is to address the concern directly with the colleague when feasible and without breaching confidentiality. If he refuses to take appropriate remedial steps (e.g., ceasing contact, seeking consultation, reporting), then formal reporting to the appropriate body may be warranted. Contacting the client would risk breaching confidentiality, and immediately filing a complaint skips the recommended initial step.", "answering_model": "openai/gpt-5", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:22:30.565205+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a3d1cc4e-5506-4d4f-86c5-3a4ab48a0b03", "evaluation_run_id": "b55840b6-2f9a-40a0-9a2d-058758ffd906", "dataset_item_id": "7e93a027-ef13-4494-a415-e9983abee5c6", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
