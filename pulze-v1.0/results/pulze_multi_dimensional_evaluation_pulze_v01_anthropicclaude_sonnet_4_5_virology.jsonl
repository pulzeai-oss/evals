Pasteur\"**\nThis is FALSE. The vaccine has undergone significant changes since Pasteur's original vaccine in 1885. Modern vaccines are much safer and more effective than the original preparation.\n\n**Choice 1: \"The original air dried spinal cord of infected rabbits was a killed vaccine\"**\nThis is TRUE and represents a special historical feature. Pasteur's original vaccine used spinal cord tissue from rabies-infected rabbits that was air-dried for varying periods (14 days down to a few days). The drying process progressively inactivated the virus, making it a killed/inactivated vaccine. This was a groundbreaking approach at the time.\n\n**Choice 2: \"The vaccine still needs 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity\"**\nThis is FALSE. Modern rabies vaccines require far fewer doses (typically 4-5 doses intramuscularly in post-exposure prophylaxis) and are NOT given intraperitoneally. The old Pasteur treatment did require multiple daily injections (up to 14-21), but this is no longer the case.\n\n**Choice 3: \"The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo\"**\nThis is partially true - human diploid cell vaccines (HDCV) like WI-38 and MRC-5 cell lines have been used for rabies vaccine production, and these cell lines were originally derived from fetal tissue. This is indeed a feature of modern rabies vaccines, though not the only type available (there are also purified chick embryo cell vaccines and Vero cell vaccines).\n\nThe answer is **1** - This describes the special historical feature of Pasteur's original rabies vaccine, which was indeed a killed vaccine made from air-dried infected rabbit spinal cord.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:53:18.617585+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "1d3839b2-0bcc-4a46-9af4-9735b3dca47c", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "025cc98d-c96d-44ac-8d77-55270fa21b9e", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Research has shown that mixed feeding significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission compared to exclusive breastfeeding. The reasons include:\n- Other foods/liquids can damage the infant's gut mucosa, making it more permeable to HIV\n- The infant's immature gut is more susceptible to inflammation and damage\n- Exclusive breastfeeding maintains gut integrity better than mixed feeding\n- Studies have demonstrated higher transmission rates with mixed feeding\n\n**Very early introduction of solids:**\nEarly introduction of solid foods (before 6 months) is problematic because:\n- It can cause micro-abrasions in the infant's immature gastrointestinal tract\n- These lesions provide entry points for HIV\n- The infant's gut is not developmentally ready for solid foods\n- This increases inflammation and compromises gut barrier function\n\nBoth of these practices have been identified by WHO and research studies as risk factors for increased HIV transmission during breastfeeding.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports that both mixed feeding and very early introduction of solids increase the risk of HIV transmission.\n\n</think>\n\n### Answer: **2) Both a and b**\n\n### Explanation:\n\nBoth **mixed feeding** and **very early introduction of solids** significantly increase the risk of perinatal HIV-1 transmission during breastfeeding.\n\n**Why Mixed Feeding Increases Risk:**\n- Damages the infant's immature intestinal mucosa\n- Creates micro-abrasions and increases gut permeability\n- Allows easier passage of HIV across the gut barrier\n- Studies show 2-4 times higher transmission risk compared to exclusive breastfeeding\n\n**Why Early Introduction of Solids Increases Risk:**\n- Causes mechanical trauma to the immature gastrointestinal tract\n- Leads to inflammation and mucosal damage\n- Compromises the protective gut barrier\n- Provides entry points for HIV particles\n\n**WHO Recommendations:**\n- **Exclusive breastfeeding** for the first 6 months is recommended for HIV-positive mothers in resource-limited settings (when replacement feeding is not feasible)\n- Avoid mixed feeding during this period\n- Delay introduction of complementary foods until 6 months\n\nThe protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding is attributed to maintaining gut integrity, reducing inflammation, and preserving the mucosal barrier that helps prevent HIV transmission.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:40:08.657193+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "cb5b7392-c928-4500-a7f1-c91aee0fecfb", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "b0c92385-90ed-4691-822d-b1abeccea1d0", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
