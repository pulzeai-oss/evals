{"question": "### Question: A good surveillance system should provide information about: ### Choices: 0) Who is being infected 1) Where the infected individuals are 2) How rapidly infection is spreading 3) All of the above", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **3) All of the above**.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nA good public health and virological surveillance system is designed to provide a comprehensive picture of a disease outbreak. Each of these pieces of information is critical for an effective response:\n\n*   **0) Who is being infected:** This involves collecting demographic data (age, sex, occupation, etc.) and clinical information (underlying conditions, vaccination status). This helps identify high-risk groups and allows for targeted public health messaging and interventions.\n*   **1) Where the infected individuals are:** Geographic data is essential for identifying hotspots and epicenters of an outbreak. This allows authorities to allocate resources (like testing kits, hospital beds, and personnel) where they are most needed and to implement localized control measures.\n*   **2) How rapidly infection is spreading:** This involves tracking metrics like the number of new cases over time (incidence), the reproduction number (Râ‚€), and the doubling time. This information tells public health officials whether an outbreak is growing, shrinking, or stable, which is crucial for deciding when to strengthen or relax control measures.\n\nTogether, these three components (Who, Where, and How rapidly) provide the actionable intelligence needed to monitor, predict, and control the spread of a virus.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:53:29.340037+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "bf98004d-b2f6-4db5-aac9-544f2403e511", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "ff2b3272-c878-43e1-9b9d-fc2f72b914cb", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: The risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 infection during breast feeding is increased due to: ### Choices: 0) Mixed feeding 1) Very early introduction of solids 2) Both a and b 3) None of them", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **2) Both a and b**.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe risk of transmitting HIV-1 from mother to child through breast milk is significantly increased by **mixed feeding**, which includes the **very early introduction of solids**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Gut Integrity:** Exclusive breastfeeding helps maintain the integrity of an infant's intestinal lining. The gut is a natural barrier against pathogens.\n2.  **Disruption by Other Foods:** When other foods, liquids (like formula, water, or juice), or solids are introduced alongside breast milk (mixed feeding), they can irritate and damage the delicate lining of the infant's gut.\n3.  **Increased Viral Entry:** This damage and inflammation create micro-lesions or openings in the gut wall, making it much easier for the HIV virus present in the breast milk to pass through the intestinal barrier and enter the infant's bloodstream, leading to infection.\n\nFor this reason, for mothers living with HIV who choose to breastfeed (and are on effective antiretroviral therapy), the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends **exclusive breastfeeding** for the first six months of life to minimize the risk of transmission.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:55:27.928316+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "6142aa63-5d63-4e8f-8648-90bc4d6beee0", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "b0c92385-90ed-4691-822d-b1abeccea1d0", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

{"question": "### Question: Which of the following is a special feature of the rabies vaccine? ### Choices: 0) The vaccine has not changed since the time of L. Pasteur 1) The original air dried spinal cord of infected rabbits was a killed vaccine 2) The vaccine still needs 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity 3) The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **3) The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is the correct answer and why the others are incorrect:\n\n*   **0) The vaccine has not changed since the time of L. Pasteur:** This is incorrect. Pasteur's original vaccine was made from the dried spinal cords of infected rabbits. Modern vaccines are highly purified and produced in cell cultures, making them much safer and more effective.\n*   **1) The original air dried spinal cord of infected rabbits was a killed vaccine:** This is incorrect. The process of air-drying the spinal cords did not kill the virus but rather weakened or **attenuated** it. It was a live-attenuated vaccine.\n*   **2) The vaccine still needs 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity:** This is incorrect. This describes the older, painful regimens. The modern post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen typically consists of one dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and a series of 4 or 5 vaccine doses given intramuscularly in the arm.\n*   **3) The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo:** This is correct. The Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV), one of the most common and effective modern rabies vaccines (e.g., Imovax), is produced by growing the rabies virus in specific human cell lines (like WI-38 or MRC-5) that were originally derived from the lung tissue of legally aborted fetuses in the 1960s. These cell lines have been propagated in labs for decades and provide a safe and consistent medium for vaccine production.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.771, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:03:37.531433+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "0a85ae44-cb70-4930-820d-4deddc3323cc", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "025cc98d-c96d-44ac-8d77-55270fa21b9e", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 0, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 5}
