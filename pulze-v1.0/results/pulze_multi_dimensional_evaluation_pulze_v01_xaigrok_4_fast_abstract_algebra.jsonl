Z_11 × Z_15 is the direct product of cyclic groups, with order 11 × 15 = 165, as the orders multiply for direct products.\n\nNext, ⟨(1,1)⟩ denotes the subgroup generated by the element (1,1) under addition. To find its order, determine the smallest positive integer m such that m(1,1) = (0,0) in Z_11 × Z_15, meaning m ≡ 0 mod 11 and m ≡ 0 mod 15. This m is the least common multiple of 11 and 15. Since 11 and 15 are coprime, lcm(11,15) = 165.\n\nThus, the order of (1,1) is 165, so ⟨(1,1)⟩ has 165 elements, matching the order of the entire group Z_11 × Z_15. This implies ⟨(1,1)⟩ is the whole group.\n\nThe factor group (Z_11 × Z_15) / ⟨(1,1)⟩ is therefore the quotient of a group by itself, which is the trivial group with order 1.\n\nAdditionally, Z_11 × Z_15 is isomorphic to Z_165 because 11 and 15 are coprime, and (1,1) generates this cyclic group, confirming the subgroup is the full group and the quotient has order 1.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:15:21.010987+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "422c62ed-9f4b-4ded-9004-b70f2fb39a07", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "1f642b9b-3a86-430d-a572-93c0af8088ad", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

The image φ(G) is a subgroup of H and isomorphic to G / ker(φ). Thus, the order of φ(G) equals |G| / |ker(φ)|, which must divide |G| = 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, so the image cannot have 12 elements, as 12 does not divide 6. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nFor Statement 2, a homomorphism exists from any group G of order 6 to any group H of order 12. For instance, the trivial homomorphism, which maps every element of G to the identity in H, preserves the group operation and qualifies as a valid homomorphism. Thus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, corresponding to choice 3.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:15:31.190184+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a8504ec9-25e0-42d4-a392-aa3d9d3d7d97", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "61459869-6242-4296-99cb-f6e7a27798cd", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

A maximal ideal M is a proper ideal not contained in any larger proper ideal, equivalent to R/M being a field.\n\nFor Statement 2: If I is a maximal ideal of R, then R/I is a field. This follows directly from the definition of a maximal ideal, as the quotient ring R/I has no proper ideals other than the zero ideal, making it a field.\n\nFor Statement 1: Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. Since R/M is a field for a maximal ideal M, and every field is an integral domain (with no zero divisors), R/M satisfies the condition for M to be prime. Thus, maximal ideals are prime ideals in this context.\n\nBoth statements hold true under the standard assumptions for commutative rings with identity, leading to the conclusion that the correct choice is 0) True, True.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.714, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:17:38.535515+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "f6bf55a1-48ce-455f-a654-f9d6e43cf117", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "babf7a74-ba8b-44ce-984e-6dad19cd36db", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 0, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 0}

Since polynomials over ℚ have finite degree, their splitting fields are finite-dimensional algebraic extensions of ℚ. However, ℝ (the real numbers) is not algebraic over ℚ, as it contains transcendental elements like π and e, and has uncountable dimension as a vector space over ℚ. Therefore, ℝ cannot be a splitting field of any polynomial over ℚ, making Statement 1 false.\n\nFor Statement 2, finite fields exist only for orders that are powers of a prime (p^k, where p is prime and k ≥ 1). The number 60 factors as 2^2 × 3 × 5, which is not a prime power.

This implies f is injective and g acts as a left inverse of f.\n\nFor Statement 1, which claims g must be injective (i.e., if g(x) = g(y), then x = y for x, y in B), a counterexample demonstrates it is not necessarily true. Consider A = {1} and B = {a, b}, with f(1) = a and g(a) = 1, g(b) = 1. Here, g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1, satisfying the condition. However, g(a) = g(b) = 1 but a ≠ b, so g is not injective. Thus, Statement 1 is false.\n\nFor Statement 2, which claims g must be surjective (i.e., for every a in A, there exists b in B such that g(b) = a), the condition directly ensures this.
