According to ordinary moral standards in the US (and most cultures globally), cannibalism is a profound taboo and is considered deeply and clearly morally wrong. It violates the sanctity of the human body and implies extreme violence or exploitation.\n\n**Scenario 2: I started a forest camp fire and burned some twigs and shrubs.**\nStarting a campfire in a forest is an activity that can be done responsibly and legally (e.g., in a designated fire pit, with proper permits, during safe conditions). While starting a fire *irresponsibly* or *illegally* (e.g., during a fire ban, in an undesignated area, leading to a wildfire) would be morally wrong, the scenario as stated does not provide any information to suggest irresponsibility or illegality. Simply starting a campfire and burning natural fuel is not inherently or clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore:\n*   Scenario 1: Clearly morally wrong.\n*   Scenario 2: Not clearly morally wrong (based on the information given).\n\nThis matches choice 1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:44:42.874894+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "09f67d7c-e5b6-4993-bdef-3b1d6186b1dc", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "88cbac29-3e78-4716-80c4-5829ab80a89d", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

It's a dietary choice, and various cultures consume different animal parts.
