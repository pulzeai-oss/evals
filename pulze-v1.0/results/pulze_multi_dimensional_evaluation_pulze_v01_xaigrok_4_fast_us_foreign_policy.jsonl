Bush in the early 1990s, particularly in speeches following the end of the Cold War and during the Gulf War (e.g., his September 1990 address to Congress). It described a post-Cold War vision of U.S.-led global cooperation through institutions like the UN, emphasizing democratic values, collective security, and multilateralism to replace the bipolar U.S.-Soviet rivalry. While it touched on economic and globalization themes, the core focus was on American leadership in fostering a stable, rules-based international order. The other options misalign: China was not a focal point, it wasn't primarily economic, and globalization was a broader trend rather than the term's intent.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:15:07.237336+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "455e11bd-e6a5-4c8c-8a9e-a934b4544d78", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "451143d1-4d60-420c-a6b2-4b42585f87ae", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Britain had incurred enormous debts to fund the conflict and station troops in the colonies for ongoing defense, leading Parliament to seek revenue directly from the colonists under the principle of \"no taxation without representation\" becoming a flashpoint.
