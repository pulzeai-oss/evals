{"question": "### Question: When a large increase in aggregate demand has an even greater increase in real GDP economists refer to this as ### Choices: 0) the balanced budget multiplier. 1) the money multiplier. 2) the foreign substitution effect. 3) the spending multiplier.", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "The question describes a situation where an initial increase in aggregate demand leads to an even greater increase in real GDP. This phenomenon is known as the **spending multiplier**.\n\nHere's why:\n*   An initial increase in spending (e.g., by consumers, businesses, or the government) becomes income for others.\n*   Those who receive this income will then spend a portion of it, which in turn becomes income for still others.\n*   This process continues, with each round of spending being a fraction of the previous round, leading to a total increase in real GDP that is a multiple of the initial increase in spending.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n*   **0) the balanced budget multiplier:** This refers to the idea that an equal increase in government spending and taxes will increase aggregate demand by the amount of the spending/tax increase. It doesn't describe the general magnified effect.\n*   **1) the money multiplier:** This describes how an initial deposit in the banking system can lead to a larger increase in the overall money supply. It's related to monetary policy, not the direct impact of aggregate demand on GDP.\n*   **2) the foreign substitution effect:** This is one reason the aggregate demand curve slopes downward. When domestic prices rise, domestic goods become relatively more expensive, leading to a decrease in net exports as consumers substitute foreign goods for domestic ones. This doesn't describe a magnified impact.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the spending multiplier.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:18:23.176064+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "0b1e6140-91e4-4178-a3b4-9fc710a98706", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "8f58cf1f-48c2-4b1e-93d5-710c145482b3", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
