{"question": "### Question: Positive integers $x$ and $y$ have a product of 56 and $x < y$. Seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14 times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4. What is the value of $x$? ### Choices: 0) 13 1) 14 2) 1 3) 2", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "2\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning begins by identifying the constraints: x and y are positive integers with x * y = 56 and x < y. The possible pairs (x, y) are derived from the factor pairs of 56: (1, 56), (2, 28), (4, 14), and (7, 8).\n\nThe given equation is 7 * (1/x) + 14 * (1/y) = 4, which simplifies to 7/y + 14/x = 4. Multiplying both sides by x y yields 7 y + 14 x = 4 x y. Substituting x y = 56 gives 7 y + 14 x = 224.\n\nDividing the equation by 7 simplifies it to y + 2 x = 32, so y = 32 - 2 x. Substituting y = 56 / x results in 56 / x = 32 - 2 x. Multiplying through by x gives 56 = 32 x - 2 x^2, or 2 x^2 - 32 x + 56 = 0. Dividing by 2 yields x^2 - 16 x + 28 = 0.\n\nSolving the quadratic equation: the discriminant is 256 - 112 = 144, so x = [16 ± 12] / 2. This produces x = 14 or x = 2.\n\nChecking against x < y: for x = 14, y = 56 / 14 = 4, but 14 > 4, which violates the condition. For x = 2, y = 56 / 2 = 28, and 2 < 28, which satisfies the condition.

Substituting gives 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 150, so (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 50.\n\nSince a, b, and c are positive integers, assume a ≤ b ≤ c, making a + b ≤ b + c ≤ c + a, with each sum at least 2.
