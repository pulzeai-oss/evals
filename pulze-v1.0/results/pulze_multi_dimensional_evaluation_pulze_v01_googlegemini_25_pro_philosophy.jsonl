{"question": "### Question: According to Hume, reason: ### Choices: 0) should serve our passions. 1) should operate completely independently of our passions. 2) should be used to direct our passions. 3) should be used to extinguish our passions.", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **0) should serve our passions.**\n\nThis is one of David Hume's most famous and provocative claims. In his *A Treatise of Human Nature*, he wrote:\n\n> \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nHume argued that reason alone cannot motivate us to act. Reason is concerned with matters of fact and logic (e.g., \"If I touch the fire, I will be burned\"). It can tell us the best way to achieve a goal, but it cannot give us the goal itself.\n\nOur goals, desires, and motivations, according to Hume, come from our **passions** (emotions, feelings, desires). We desire pleasure and want to avoid pain. Reason's job is purely instrumental: it helps us figure out how to get what our passions want.\n\n*   **Choice 1 is incorrect** because, for Hume, reason is inert and useless without the passions to give it a goal.\n*   **Choice 2 is incorrect** because this is the view Hume was arguing *against*. Philosophers like Plato and Aristotle believed reason should rule over and direct the passions. Hume reverses this, saying the passions are in charge.\n*   **Choice 3 is incorrect** as this is more aligned with certain Stoic or ascetic philosophies. Hume saw passions as the very source of human action and motivation, not something to be eliminated.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:53:02.751872+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "1b692bc3-0686-4822-ba89-4b97ca78eb59", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "1b02cec1-4337-4c7e-ab6f-65b0f12a70df", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

An action is rational if it can be justified through this deliberative process as the best means to achieve one's ends.\n\n*   **Moral justification (0)** is what Gauthier tries to *derive from* rationality, not what rationality *is*.

While legal guidelines often permit filming or photography in public spaces without explicit consent, the ethical definition of what is \"public\" can be more nuanced. A researcher must consider whether individuals in that space have a reasonable expectation of privacy, even if it's legally public.\n*   **1) Protecting individuals from potential harm:** This is a core principle of research ethics. Harm can be psychological (e.g., embarrassment, distress), social (e.g., stigma, damage to reputation), or even physical. Researchers must anticipate and mitigate any potential harm that could result from capturing, analyzing, or disseminating visual data.\n*   **2) Any risk of invasion of privacy:** This goes hand-in-hand with the other two points. Even in a public space, using a telephoto lens to capture a private conversation or a moment of vulnerability could be a significant invasion of privacy. Researchers must respect the dignity and privacy of their subjects, which often requires going beyond what is strictly legal.\n\nTherefore, a researcher must consider all these ethical dimensions in addition to adhering to the law.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:57:34.187729+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "6ef3c071-d1d8-4596-bb28-6a3f5ff5b036", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "35c15c54-cedc-47fc-a349-0a90a76bcdc3", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
