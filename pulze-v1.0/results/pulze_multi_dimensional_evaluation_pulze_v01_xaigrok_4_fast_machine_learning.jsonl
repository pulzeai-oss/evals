This ensures that the data samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution, allowing reliable generalization and unbiased performance evaluation, as seen in standard algorithms like linear regression or support vector machines.\n\nFor Statement 2, in 2017, models trained on the COCO dataset for tasks such as object detection were commonly pretrained on ImageNet. This transfer learning approach was prevalent due to ImageNet's large scale and diversity, which provided robust feature representations that improved performance on COCO, as evidenced by competitions and papers from that period, such as those using architectures like ResNet or Faster R-CNN.\n\nBoth statements align with these facts, leading to the selection of option 0) True, True.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:24:40.813944+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "36d633d5-f33e-496d-8cb2-1e688bde5ecb", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "7e8b62f5-50b7-4815-8679-2d46b6f53ec7", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Start by identifying the given probabilities: P(D) = 0.05, so P(not D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95; P(TP|D) = 0.99; and P(not TP|not D) = 0.97, which implies P(TP|not D) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03.\n\nApply the law of total probability: P(TP) = P(TP|D) × P(D) + P(TP|not D) × P(not D).\n\nSubstitute the values: P(TP) = (0.99 × 0.05) + (0.03 × 0.95).\n\nFirst, calculate 0.99 × 0.05 = 0.0495.\n\nThen, calculate 0.03 × 0.95 = 0.0285.\n\nAdd the results: 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078.\n\nThis value matches one of the provided choices, confirming the calculation.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.96, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:28:52.769348+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "01ba370b-b6aa-4ad3-a2a3-fe90b458c7b3", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "9fd49eeb-2162-4e04-bde5-e525fec0a327", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}

The computational cost arises primarily from these K training runs. Assuming training time scales linearly with the dataset size, each run processes approximately (K-1)/K of the data, which is roughly proportional to the full dataset size for large K. Thus, the total computation is the product of K trainings and the cost per training, resulting in a complexity that is linear in K. This holds for standard implementations without additional factors like nested hyperparameter tuning, making the overall process O(K * N), where N is the dataset size.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.97, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:38:47.440726+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "5307bf16-6c8c-4da1-92d5-0551d7c88730", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "3e4124cd-2e9e-4188-84d5-c1464673cf57", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}

Composing these yields \\( g_3(g_2(g_1(x))) = W_3 (W_2 (W_1 x)) = (W_3 W_2 W_1) x \\), which is a linear transformation.

The pointwise maximum of convex functions is convex, so this statement is true.\n\nFor choice 2, the function \\( \\operatorname{ReLU}(x) - \\operatorname{ReLU}(x-1) \\), where \\( \\operatorname{ReLU}(x) = \\max(x, 0) \\), is analyzed piecewise: it equals 0 for \\( x < 0 \\), \\( x \\) for \\( 0 \\leq x < 1 \\), and 1 for \\( x \\geq 1 \\). The slopes of this piecewise linear function are 0 for \\( x < 0 \\), 1 for \\( 0 \\leq x < 1 \\), and 0 for \\( x \\geq 1 \\). For convexity in one dimension, slopes must be non-decreasing, but here the slope decreases from 1 to 0 at \\( x = 1 \\). Additionally, testing points such as \\( x = 0.5 \\) (value 0.5) and \\( x = 1.5 \\) (value 1) shows the midpoint \\( x = 1 \\) (value 1) exceeds the average of the function values (0.75), violating the convexity inequality.
