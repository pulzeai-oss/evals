This is due to several factors:\n   - Aging population (more people living to ages where Alzheimer's is common)\n   - Better diagnosis and recognition of the disease\n   - Increased reporting of Alzheimer's as a cause of death on death certificates\n   - The death rate from Alzheimer's has increased significantly, with some estimates showing it has more than doubled\n\n2. **Cancer**: While cancer remains a leading cause of death, the overall cancer death rate has actually been declining in recent years due to better treatments, earlier detection, and reduced smoking rates.\n\n3. **Cardiovascular diseases**: Heart disease and stroke death rates have been declining over the past few decades due to better treatments, medications, lifestyle changes, and improved emergency care.\n\n4. **Homicide**: Homicide rates have fluctuated but have not shown a \"huge increase\" over the past two decades. In fact, homicide rates in many developed countries have remained relatively stable or decreased compared to peaks in earlier decades.\n\nThe answer that shows a \"huge increase\" is clearly **Alzheimer's disease**. The number of deaths attributed to Alzheimer's has increased dramatically, making it one of the fastest-growing causes of death in developed nations.\n</think>\n\n**Answer: 0) Alzheimer's**\n\nOver the last decade or two, **Alzheimer's disease** has shown a huge increase as a cause of death. Key factors include:\n\n- **Aging population**: More people are living into their 80s and 90s when Alzheimer's risk is highest\n- **Better diagnosis**: Improved recognition and diagnosis of the disease\n- **Increased reporting**: Alzheimer's is now more frequently listed as the underlying or contributing cause of death on death certificates\n\nIn contrast:\n- **Cancer** death rates have been declining due to better treatments and prevention\n- **Cardiovascular disease** deaths have decreased significantly due to improved medications and interventions\n- **Homicide** rates have remained relatively stable or decreased in most developed countries\n\nAlzheimer's disease has become one of the leading causes of death in the United States and other developed nations, with death rates increasing by over 100% in some regions during this period.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:07:43.832164+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "662d9a38-1172-4d36-bf99-5b93b2613269", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "64888354-06c0-4623-872d-774e35622430", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: Which of the following has been found to improve balance for older adults? ### Choices: 0) Tai chi 1) Aerobic exercise 2) Weight lifting 3) Walking briskly", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "<think>\nThis question asks about which activity has been found to improve balance for older adults.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\n0) **Tai chi** - This is a mind-body practice involving slow, controlled movements, weight shifting, and maintaining various postures. It specifically emphasizes balance, coordination, and body awareness. Multiple research studies have demonstrated that tai chi is particularly effective at improving balance in older adults and reducing fall risk.\n\n1) **Aerobic exercise** - While beneficial for cardiovascular health and overall fitness, general aerobic exercise doesn't specifically target balance training.\n\n2) **Weight lifting** - This can improve strength, which indirectly helps with balance, but it doesn't specifically train balance skills unless combined with balance-specific exercises.\n\n3) **Walking briskly** - This is good for cardiovascular fitness and leg strength, but doesn't specifically challenge or improve balance in the same way as balance-specific training.\n\nTai chi has been extensively studied and consistently shown to be one of the most effective interventions for improving balance in older adults. It combines multiple elements that contribute to balance: strength, flexibility, proprioception, and coordination. Major health organizations, including the CDC, specifically recommend tai chi for fall prevention in older adults.\n\nThe answer is **0) Tai chi**.\n</think>\n\n**Answer: 0) Tai chi**\n\nTai chi has been extensively researched and consistently shown to be highly effective at improving balance in older adults. This ancient Chinese practice involves:\n\n- Slow, controlled movements that challenge balance\n- Weight shifting between legs\n- Coordination and body awareness training\n- Strengthening of core and leg muscles\n- Improved proprioception (body position sense)\n\n**Key evidence:**\n- Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate tai chi significantly reduces fall risk in older adults\n- The CDC specifically recommends tai chi as an evidence-based fall prevention program\n- Studies show improvements in both static and dynamic balance measures\n\nWhile aerobic exercise, weight lifting, and brisk walking all have health benefits for older adults, tai chi is uniquely effective for balance improvement because it specifically trains the neuromuscular systems involved in maintaining stability and preventing falls.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:19:44.390029+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "8c04d803-c6b2-4a38-9d3d-57146b7c5310", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "e1905f06-fa8a-4d4e-9ac9-242a2d6242c1", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Negative stereotypes about older adults (e.g., being forgetful, slow, incompetent, frail) are widespread and have significant impacts on older adults' health, performance, and well-being.\n\n2) They never last very long - This is incorrect. Age stereotypes are actually quite persistent and enduring across time and cultures.\n\n3) They are very rare - This is clearly false. Age stereotypes are actually very common and pervasive in most societies.\n\nThe research literature on ageism and age stereotypes, including work by researchers like Becca Levy and others, has demonstrated that negative age stereotypes are particularly strong and pervasive.

The groups already exist naturally (e.g., comparing different age groups, genders, educational backgrounds, etc.). This is ideal for studying differences between pre-existing groups.\n\n**Longitudinal approach**: This involves studying the same individuals over an extended period of time to observe changes. It's focused on tracking development or change within individuals/groups over time, not primarily on comparing different groups.\n\n**Correlational approach**: This examines relationships between variables to see if they are associated with each other. While it can involve groups, its primary purpose is to identify relationships, not to compare group differences.\n\n**Cross-sequential approach**: This combines cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, studying multiple age cohorts over time. While it does involve group comparisons, it's specifically designed for developmental research.\n\nWhen a researcher is primarily interested in **differences between two or more groups of people** (e.g., comparing men vs. women, different age groups, different treatment groups), the **quasi-experimental approach** is most appropriate because:\n- It's specifically designed for group comparisons\n- It accommodates pre-existing groups that cannot be randomly assigned\n- It focuses on between-group differences\n\n**The answer is: 0) Quasi-experimental**", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:33:01.134367+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "902b83b3-da67-4d2b-b7ab-48f4c1c03012", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "e273ef6e-3025-440b-bdc5-a1bafb28b7d7", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
