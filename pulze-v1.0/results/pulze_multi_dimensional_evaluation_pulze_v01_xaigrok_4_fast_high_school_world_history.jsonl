Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land!

This created a significant trade deficit for Britain, as demand for Chinese tea, silk, and porcelain outstripped what China would buy in return. To address this imbalance and reverse the outflow of silver, British merchants (via the East India Company) increasingly exported opium from India to China starting in the early 19th century, despite its addictive and harmful effects. This economic pressure set the stage for the tensions described in Lin Zexu's letter and the ensuing First Opium War (1839–1842).", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:34:02.661507+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "ed109a82-d415-4ab8-9d6f-0b79dd05fd84", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "6e8743c1-ff4e-4a7d-85de-45fda3eab34d", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
