{"question": "### Question: Including more than one claim in a proposition may lead to which of the following fallacies? ### Choices: 0) Complex question 1) Appeal to ignorance 2) Compound proposition 3) Extension", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The question asks which fallacy may arise from including more than one claim in a proposition. Let's analyze the choices:\n\n*   **0) Complex question (or Loaded question):** This fallacy occurs when a question is asked that presupposes the truth of a claim (or multiple claims) that has not been established or accepted by all parties. Answering the question directly, whether \"yes\" or \"no,\" implies acceptance of the unproven claim(s) embedded within it. For example, \"Have you stopped cheating on exams?\" includes the unproven claim that the person *was* cheating on exams. This directly fits the description of including more than one claim (one of which is an unproven assumption) in a proposition (the question).\n\n*   **1) Appeal to ignorance (Ad ignorantiam):** This fallacy argues that a claim is true because it has not been proven false, or false because it has not been proven true. This has no direct relation to including multiple claims in a single proposition.\n\n*   **2) Compound proposition:** In logic, a compound proposition is simply a proposition formed by combining two or more simple propositions using logical connectives (like \"and,\" \"or,\" \"if...then\"). While it *does* contain more than one claim, it is a *structural description* of a proposition, not inherently a *fallacy*. A compound proposition can be perfectly valid and non-fallacious. The question asks for a *fallacy*.\n\n*   **3) Extension:** This is not a standard, recognized logical fallacy. While some fallacies might involve \"extending\" an argument (like a straw man or slippery slope), \"extension\" itself is not the name of a fallacy related to including multiple claims in a proposition.\n\nThe \"Complex question\" fallacy specifically addresses the problem of embedding multiple claims, particularly unproven or controversial ones, within a single proposition (often a question) in a way that forces the respondent to implicitly accept those claims.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.771, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:53:48.485314+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "32aeddec-31e4-4402-b7b9-831042a44db1", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "361e8667-7736-4ff1-b1de-9c3d00cf0e24", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 0, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 5}

It doesn't involve discrediting a source.\n*   **2) poisoning the well**: This fallacy involves presenting adverse information about a target person with the intention of discrediting anything that the target person might say. It's a preemptive *ad hominem* attack designed to make an audience reject a person's arguments *before* they are even made, by making the source seem unreliable or flawed. This perfectly matches the description provided in the question.\n*   **3) appeal to anonymous authority**: This fallacy occurs when an argument relies on the testimony of an unnamed expert or source, making it impossible to verify their credibility.
