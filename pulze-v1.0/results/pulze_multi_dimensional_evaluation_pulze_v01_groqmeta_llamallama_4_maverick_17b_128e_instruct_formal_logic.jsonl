The propositions are: (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U), T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X), and (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W.\n\n## Step ## Step 2: Write down the given propositions\n1. (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)\n2. T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)\n3. (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W\n\n## Step ## Step 3: Apply the indirect truth table method\nTo check for consistency, we assume the set is inconsistent and then try to derive a contradiction. If we find a valuation that makes all propositions true, the set is consistent.\n\n## Step ## Step 4: Analyze the propositions\nLet's start by analyzing the propositions:\n1. (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U) is false if (T ⊃ U) is true and (W ⊃ U) is false. This means T ⊃ U is true and W ⊃ U is false. For W ⊃ U to be false, W must be true and U must be false.\n2. T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X) being true when U is false simplifies to T ⊃ ~(false ⊃ X), which simplifies further to T ⊃ ~true, and then to T ⊃ false, meaning T must be false because anything implying false must be false.\n3. (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W, given T is false, makes (T ⊃ ~X) true because false implies anything is true. So, we have true ⊃ W, which means W must be true for the statement to be true.\n\n## Step ## Step 5: Check for consistency with the given valuations\nLet's check the consistency with the valuations given in the choices:\n- For choice 1: U, W, and X are true, and T is false. Let's evaluate the propositions with these values.\n1. (false ⊃ true) ⊃ (true ⊃ true) = true ⊃ true = true\n2. false ⊃ ~(true ⊃ true) = false ⊃ ~true = false ⊃ false = true\n3. (false ⊃ ~true) ⊃ true = (false ⊃ false) ⊃ true = true ⊃ true = true\nAll propositions are true, so this valuation is consistent.\n\n## Step ## Step 6: Evaluate other choices if necessary\nSince we found a consistent valuation, we can stop here and check if it matches any of the given choices.\n\n## Step ## Step 7: Match the consistent valuation to the given choices\nChoice 1: U, W, and X are true, and T is false. This matches our consistent valuation.\n\nThe best answer is 1.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.96, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:20:38.418077+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "c5888550-4f0a-4aa1-be98-cb1b592c94ba", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "f56a68f2-6253-47e0-bade-067288d048ef", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}
