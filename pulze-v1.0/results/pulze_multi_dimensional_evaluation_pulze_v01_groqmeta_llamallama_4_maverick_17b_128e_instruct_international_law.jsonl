{"question": "### Question: What is the relationship between the formal sources of international law? ### Choices: 0) There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law 1) Treaties supersede custom 2) Custom supersedes treaties 3) General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the concept of formal sources of international law\nThe formal sources of international law are outlined in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, which includes treaties, customary international law, general principles of law, and judicial decisions and teachings of the most highly qualified publicists as subsidiary means.\n\n## Step 2: Examine the hierarchy among the formal sources\nTo determine the relationship between these sources, we need to consider if there is an established hierarchy. The Statute of the International Court of Justice lists these sources without explicitly stating a hierarchy, suggesting that they may be considered equal or that their application depends on the context.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the role of each source\n- Treaties are agreements between states that are binding under international law.\n- Customary international law refers to practices that states follow out of a sense of legal obligation.\n- General principles of law are principles recognized by civilized nations, which can be applied in international law.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the application of these sources in practice\nIn practice, the application of these sources can vary. For instance, a treaty can override customary international law between the parties to the treaty, but it does not necessarily change customary law for other states. Customary law and general principles can fill gaps where treaties are silent or not applicable.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the given choices\n0) There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law: This suggests that all sources are considered equally, with the applicability depending on the specific circumstances of a case.\n1) Treaties supersede custom: This implies a hierarchy where treaties are superior to custom, which is not always the case as custom can be binding on all states, not just those party to a treaty.\n2) Custom supersedes treaties: Similarly, this suggests custom is superior, which is also not universally true as treaties can specifically agree to depart from customary rules among the signatory states.\n3) General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties: This implies that general principles have a superior status, which is not necessarily the case as their application is also context-dependent.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the most accurate statement regarding the hierarchy\nThe most accurate reflection of international law is that there is no strict hierarchy among its formal sources. The application of treaties, custom, and general principles depends on the context, including the specific issue at hand and the states involved.\n\nThe best answer is 0.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:28:03.710919+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "d090de50-3ac1-4611-9121-f93ec8b55f43", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "c4799b6a-80bc-4192-abd8-5508590c0e49", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

The most relevant concept related to implied authorisation involves understanding the UNSC's stance or actions as implicitly supporting or authorising certain measures.\n\n## Step 7: Choose the most appropriate definition\nGiven the descriptions, choice 0 (\"Presumption of Security Council approval of armed force when a State has been forewarned\") aligns closely with the concept of implied authorisation, as it suggests that under certain conditions (like a state being forewarned), the UNSC's approval or authorisation for the use of armed force can be presumed or implied.\n\nThe best answer is 0.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.96, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:34:52.946550+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "f84e9404-d05f-416d-9b98-63d8327e38dc", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "e261652f-467b-4e05-831a-cfe659a91942", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 9, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

While interpretation is crucial in international law, this does not directly relate to the concept of 'secondary rules' as defined in the context of state responsibility.\n\n## Step ## Step 4: Analyze choice 1.\nChoice 1 states that 'secondary rules' are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules, i.e., of the international obligations of the States. This aligns with the understanding that primary rules are the substantive obligations, and secondary rules deal with the consequences of breaching those obligations.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze choice 2.\nChoice 2 suggests that 'secondary rules' govern exclusively the concept of attribution in the law of international responsibility. Attribution is a part of the law of international responsibility, but saying 'secondary rules' govern exclusively this concept is too narrow, as the law of international responsibility encompasses more than just attribution.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze choice 3.\nChoice 3 proposes that 'secondary rules' are the rules that govern exclusively the law of countermeasures. Countermeasures are a part of the law of international responsibility, representing actions taken by a state in response to another state's breach of international law. However, 'secondary rules' cannot be limited to just countermeasures, as they cover a broader range of legal consequences.\n\n## Step 7: Relate the concept of 'secondary rules' to the work of the International Law Commission (ILC) on the law of international responsibility.\nThe ILC's work on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) is pivotal. The distinction between primary and secondary rules is fundamental in this context. Primary rules are the obligations that states must comply with, while secondary rules concern the consequences of a breach of those primary rules.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude based on the understanding of 'secondary rules'.\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate description of 'secondary rules' is provided in choice 1, as it correctly identifies that 'secondary rules' govern the legal consequences of breaching primary rules (international obligations).\n\nThe best answer is 1.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.96, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:35:29.196227+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "6f14d28c-8cf6-4cfe-9dfa-fc100c77757b", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "c474b22a-8b0a-4509-8f4b-d58f57052354", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 9, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Derogation is about suspending obligations, not about bringing claims.\n2) A State may suspend particular rights by means of a derogation in circumstances that threaten its existence - This is a correct description of derogation.
