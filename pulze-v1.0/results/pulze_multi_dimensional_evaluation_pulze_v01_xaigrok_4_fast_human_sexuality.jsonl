This fetal signal is the primary trigger, distinguishing it from maternal hormonal contributions (like ovarian or hypothalamic hormones) or downstream effects (like placental/uterine prostaglandins).", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:24:23.156453+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "427b37f6-bef3-48a2-83f2-b64cb52614d4", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "455e23f4-04d2-43b3-8a84-b5c24fe149b6", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
