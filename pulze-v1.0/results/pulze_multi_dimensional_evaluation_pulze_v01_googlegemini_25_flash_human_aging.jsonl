This is largely attributed to an aging population (as Alzheimer's risk increases with age) and improved diagnosis and reporting of the disease as a primary cause of death.\n*   **Cancer:** While cancer remains a leading cause of death, overall cancer mortality rates have generally been *decreasing* in many developed countries over the last few decades due to advances in prevention, early detection, and treatment.\n*   **Cardiovascular diseases:** Deaths from cardiovascular diseases (like heart attack and stroke) have also generally been *decreasing* over the last several decades due to better prevention, lifestyle changes, and medical treatments.\n*   **Homicide:** Homicide rates fluctuate, but they do not represent a \"huge increase\" in the overall context of major causes of death across a decade or two, especially when compared to chronic diseases affecting an aging population.\n\nData from organizations like the CDC consistently show that while mortality rates for heart disease and cancer have declined, those for Alzheimer's disease have risen substantially.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:33:48.037669+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "9142c731-77a3-4bd4-9e7c-46da06f6a216", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "64888354-06c0-4623-872d-774e35622430", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Its slow, controlled movements, weight shifting, and focus on posture directly challenge and train the balance system.\n\nWhile aerobic exercise and weight lifting also contribute to overall fitness and can indirectly support balance (e.g., stronger legs from weight lifting), Tai chi is specifically recognized for its direct and significant impact on balance improvement.

Researchers use this when they cannot or should not randomly assign participants to groups (e.g., comparing men vs. women, people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, or students in different schools). The primary goal is to identify differences between these groups on some outcome variable. This directly aligns with the question.\n\n*   **1) Longitudinal:** This approach involves studying the *same group* of people over an extended period of time. Its main purpose is to observe changes or development *within* individuals or a group over time, not primarily to compare distinct groups at a single point.\n\n*   **2) Correlational:** This approach examines the statistical relationship or association between two or more variables. While you might compare correlations *between* groups, the core of a correlational study is to understand how variables relate to each other, not necessarily to highlight differences between distinct groups as its primary aim.\n\n*   **3) Cross-sequential:** This is a complex developmental design that combines elements of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. It involves studying multiple age groups (like cross-sectional) and then following each of these groups over time (like longitudinal). While it involves multiple groups, its specific purpose is to disentangle age, cohort, and time-of-measurement effects, which is more specific than just \"differences between two or more groups.\"\n\nGiven the options, the **quasi-experimental** approach is the most direct and general method for a researcher whose primary interest is to identify and understand differences between two or more distinct groups of people.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.9857142857142858, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:54:16.531711+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "d11f9335-639f-4fa9-bf4a-691e628c4b32", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "e273ef6e-3025-440b-bdc5-a1bafb28b7d7", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
