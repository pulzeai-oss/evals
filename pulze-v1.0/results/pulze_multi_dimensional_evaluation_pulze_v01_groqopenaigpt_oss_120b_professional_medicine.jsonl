{"question": "### Question: A 64-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of increasing shortness of breath, sore throat, and a cough productive of a small amount of white phlegm. Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland.

The size of the mass, its peripheral location, and the fact that it is a solitary lesion with nodal spread are more typical of NSCLC rather than small‑cell carcinoma, which tends to present with central lesions and early widespread metastases.\n- The other answer choices are far less likely:\n  - **Mesothelioma** arises from pleural surfaces and is strongly associated with asbestos exposure; it does not present as a solitary parenchymal lung mass with adrenal metastasis.\n  - **Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast** would require a known breast primary; there is no history or clinical evidence of breast disease.\n  - **Multiple endocrine neoplasia** is a hereditary syndrome causing endocrine tumors (e.g., medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma) and does not present with a solitary lung mass.\n\nThus, a biopsy of the lung lesion would most likely reveal features of a non‑small cell lung carcinoma.", "answering_model": "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:56:52.385004+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "79b956eb-b47d-4dd9-881c-eddcaae001ab", "evaluation_run_id": "55c9d212-ef47-4102-8350-c68f2d30c738", "dataset_item_id": "6042916f-a4ca-4595-a515-a69fa4b32790", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
