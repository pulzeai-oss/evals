A palpable median groove (sulcus) in the prostate is a normal anatomical finding on digital rectal examination, not adverse. Adverse findings would include nodules, asymmetry, or induration suggesting malignancy.\n- **Choice 1**: Correct. Impacted feces can form a firm, irregular mass that mimics a rectal tumor on palpation, potentially leading to diagnostic confusion until cleared or further evaluated (e.g., via imaging or biopsy).\n- **Choice 2**: Incorrect. Thrombosed hemorrhoids (clotted external or internal) are typically painful due to inflammation and pressure from the thrombus, often requiring urgent intervention.\n- **Choice 3**: Incorrect. Perianal warts (condylomata acuminata, often due to HPV) are visible externally around the anus on simple inspection or anoscopy; proctoscopy is not required but may be used if intra-anal extension is suspected.\n\nThis highlights the importance of thorough history, exam, and follow-up (e.g., sigmoidoscopy) to differentiate benign from malignant rectal findings.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:15:59.756513+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a66196b8-cc33-49d4-8a97-c561e0b1e3d2", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "1ba05daa-2661-45fd-ab4f-b6f19eb42f27", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Haemorrhoids typically cause bright red blood per rectum (fresh bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract). Melaena (black, tarry stools) indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding, such as from peptic ulcers.\n- **Option 1**: True. Pregnancy is a well-established risk factor due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from the growing uterus, hormonal changes that relax vein walls, and constipation (common in pregnancy), all of which can contribute to haemorrhoidal development.\n- **Option 2**: False. First-degree haemorrhoids are internal, do not prolapse, and cause painless bleeding (often noticed on toilet paper or in the toilet). Pain is more associated with external haemorrhoids, thrombosis, or higher-grade prolapse.\n- **Option 3**: False. Second-degree haemorrhoids prolapse during defecation but can spontaneously return to the anal canal or be manually reduced. Inability to reduce indicates third- or fourth-degree haemorrhoids.\n\nHaemorrhoids are graded by the Goligher classification, and management depends on symptoms and grade (e.g., conservative for first/second-degree, surgical for advanced cases).

When the arm is positioned above the heart, the gravitational pull reduces the pressure in the brachial artery at the measurement site, leading to lower systolic and diastolic readings (typically by ~2 mmHg per inch above heart level).
