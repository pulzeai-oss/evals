{"question": "### Question: Which of the following best describes the human body's defense mechanism against environmental bacteria? ### Choices: 0) Hair in the nose 1) Mucous membranes 2) Osteoblasts 3) Saliva", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "**1) Mucous membranes**\n\nMucous membranes line the body's entry points (e.g., nose, mouth, lungs, and digestive tract) and produce sticky mucus that traps environmental bacteria, viruses, and particles, preventing them from invading deeper tissues. This is a primary nonspecific physical and chemical barrier in the immune system. The other options play minor roles (e.g., nasal hair filters particles but doesn't trap bacteria as effectively; saliva has antibacterial enzymes but is limited to the mouth; osteoblasts build bone and are unrelated).", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:22:39.369315+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "f2fa3fb8-69ff-4fd6-bf1a-7ef7e81355a5", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "6e8c02b0-1265-4b0a-90ce-b7078fe61166", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
