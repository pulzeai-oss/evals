This is a fundamental property of electrostatic forces.\n\n**What actually holds the nucleus together?**\nThe nucleus is held together by the **strong nuclear force** (not electrical force), which is much stronger than the electromagnetic force at very short distances and overcomes the electrical repulsion between protons.\n\n**Evaluating the choices:**\n- Choice 0 (hold particles together): Incorrect - this is what the strong force does, not electrical forces\n- Choice 1 (push particles apart): **Correct** - electrical forces between like-charged protons are repulsive\n- Choice 2 (produce orbital motion): Incorrect - not relevant to nuclear structure\n- Choice 3 (charge particles): Incorrect - forces don't charge particles; particles have intrinsic charge\n\n**Answer: 1) push particles apart**\n\nThe electrical forces between protons in the nucleus are repulsive and tend to push the nucleus apart.

When the products are created, they move apart to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is essentially zero (or very small if the reactants have some initial kinetic energy), the products must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\nFor momentum conservation:\np_alpha = p_neutron (in magnitude, opposite directions)\n\nSince kinetic energy KE = p²/(2m), and the momenta are equal:\n- The neutron has much less mass than the alpha particle (1 amu vs 4 amu)\n- With equal momentum, KE = p²/(2m), so the lighter particle gets more kinetic energy\n- KE_neutron/KE_alpha = m_alpha/m_neutron = 4/1\n\nSo the energy splits in a 4:1 ratio, with the neutron getting 4/5 of the kinetic energy and the alpha particle getting 1/5.\n\nOf the 17.6 MeV released:\n- Neutron: ~14.1 MeV\n- Alpha particle: ~3.5 MeV\n\nGamma radiation is not a significant product of this reaction.
