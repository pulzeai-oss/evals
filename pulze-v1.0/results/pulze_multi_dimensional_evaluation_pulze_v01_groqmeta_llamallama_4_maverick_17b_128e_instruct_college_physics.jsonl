Helium has two electrons, and when both are removed, we are left with a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons). The energy required to remove both electrons is given as 79.0 eV.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the ionization energy of hydrogen-like atoms\nThe energy required to remove an electron from a hydrogen-like atom (an atom with one electron) is given by the formula $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times Z^2$, where $Z$ is the atomic number of the atom. For helium, $Z = 2$, so when it is ionized to become He$^+$, the energy required to remove the remaining electron from He$^+$ is $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 2^2 = 54.4 \\, \\text{eV}$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the energy required to remove the first electron\nLet's denote the energy required to remove the first electron from helium as $E_1$ and the energy required to remove the second electron (from He$^+$) as $E_2$.

When it drops a payload, the payload initially shares the same velocity as the airplane.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the forces acting on the payload after it is dropped.\nSince air resistance is neglected, the only force acting on the payload after it is dropped is gravity, which acts downward.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the motion of the payload relative to the airplane.\nThe payload continues to move northward with the same initial velocity it had when it was released because there are no forces acting in the horizontal direction. Vertically, it accelerates downward due to gravity.\n\n## Step\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the vertical velocity of the payload 4.0 s after it is released.\nThe acceleration due to gravity is 10 m/s^2. Using the equation v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s in the vertical direction), a is the acceleration (10 m/s^2), and t is the time (4.0 s), we can find the vertical velocity. v = 0 + 10 m/s^2 * 4.0 s = 40 m/s.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the velocity of the payload relative to the airplane.\nSince both the airplane and the payload are moving northward at 100 m/s, their relative velocity in the northward direction is 0. The payload's velocity relative to the airplane is thus solely in the downward direction, which we've calculated to be 40 m/s.\n\n## Step 6: Choose the correct answer based on the relative velocity calculated.\nThe velocity of the payload relative to the plane is 40 m/s downward.\n\nThe best answer is 1.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.94, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:25:48.618699+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "465d0aba-b0f0-4034-9404-c96738df90c4", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "6e14c890-727a-403c-8ab3-b626c5019cc5", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 9, "completeness": 9, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

The formula is given by $E = \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law to the given situation\nGiven that the absolute temperature of the blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, we need to calculate the new energy radiated per second per unit area. Initially, $E_1 = \\sigma T^4$. After the temperature increase, $T$ becomes $3T$, so $E_2 = \\sigma (3T)^4 = \\sigma 3^4 T^4 = \\sigma 81 T^4$.\n\n## Step 3: Compare the initial and final energy radiated per second per unit area\nTo find the factor by which the energy radiated per second per unit area changes, we compare $E_2$ to $E_1$. So, $E_2 = 81 \\sigma T^4 = 81 E_1$. This means $E_2$ is 81 times $E_1$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the correct answer based on the comparison\nSince $E_2 = 81 E_1$, the energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81.\n\nThe best answer is 3.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:50:45.962271+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "4ed81185-573d-456f-b541-baaccf21c52f", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "3473d282-153e-4f39-aa0d-86c9c140ab06", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
