Pasteur:** This is incorrect. Pasteur's original vaccine was a live attenuated virus from dried rabbit spinal cords. Modern vaccines are inactivated (killed) viruses produced in cell cultures and are much safer and more effective.\n*   **1) The original air dried spinal cord of infected rabbits was a killed vaccine:** This is incorrect. Pasteur's original vaccine was a *live attenuated* vaccine. The drying process attenuated (weakened) the virus, but it was not a killed vaccine.\n*   **2) The vaccine still needs 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity:** This is incorrect. Modern rabies vaccine regimens are much simpler, typically involving 4-5 intramuscular doses for post-exposure prophylaxis, along with rabies immunoglobulin. The peritoneal cavity is not used.\n*   **3) The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo:** This is a true statement about one type of modern rabies vaccine, specifically Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV). Cell lines like WI-38 and MRC-5, used for vaccine production, were originally derived from aborted fetal tissue in the 1960s. While the cell lines are now continuously cultured and do not require new abortions, their origin is from aborted embryos.

{"question": "### Question: The risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 infection during breast feeding is increased due to: ### Choices: 0) Mixed feeding 1) Very early introduction of solids 2) Both a and b 3) None of them", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **2) Both a and b**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Mixed feeding (0):** Introducing any food or liquid other than breast milk (even water or formula) to an infant who is also breastfeeding is known as mixed feeding. This practice significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission. The reasons include:\n    *   **Gut damage:** Other foods/liquids can damage the infant's immature gut lining, making it more permeable to the virus.\n    *   **Reduced protective factors:** It reduces the exposure to the protective antibodies and other anti-infective factors present in breast milk.\n    *   **Increased viral load in milk:** Less frequent breastfeeding can lead to breast engorgement or mastitis in the mother, which can increase the viral load in her breast milk.\n\n*   **Very early introduction of solids (1):** This is a specific type of mixed feeding. Introducing solid foods too early (before 6 months) is particularly risky because:\n    *   The infant's gut is not fully developed to handle solids, leading to greater potential for gut irritation, inflammation, and damage, which increases permeability to HIV.\n    *   It displaces breast milk, reducing the protective benefits.\n\nSince both mixed feeding in general and the specific instance of very early introduction of solids are well-established risk factors for increased perinatal HIV-1 transmission during breastfeeding, option 2 is the most accurate answer.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:00:11.273727+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "82abec64-2fde-4226-86f9-8371d375f6cd", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "b0c92385-90ed-4691-822d-b1abeccea1d0", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
