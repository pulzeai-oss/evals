{"question": "### Question: One Sunday afternoon, a sports fan went to a professional football game. While standing in line at a concession stand, he got into an argument with three men ahead of him in the line. The three men were friends attending the game together. One of the men punched the sports fan in the mouth. A fight ensued. During the fracas, one of the other three men hit the sports fan over the head with a bottle, which caused him to suffer a serious concussion. The sports fan does not know for certain which of the three men struck him with the bottle. If the sports fan asserts a claim against the man who punched him in the mouth to recover damages for the head injury, will the sports fan prevail? ### Choices: 0) Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth was the instigator who struck the first blow that started the fracas. 1) Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth and the other men were acting in concert. 2) No, because the man who punched him in the mouth did not actually strike the sports fan with the bottle. 3) No, because the sports fan cannot offer proof as to which of the men struck the sports fan over the head with the bottle.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "Answer: 1) Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth and the other men were acting in concert.\n\nExplanation: When multiple defendants act in concert to commit an intentional tort (e.g., a group fight), each participant is jointly and severally liable for the harm caused by any of them in furtherance of that concerted action. The sports fan need not prove which specific man swung the bottle if he shows they were acting together. Instigation alone (choice 0) is not enough without concert, and choices 2 and 3 ignore concert liability.", "answering_model": "openai/gpt-5", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:52:32.460893+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "fd3e0776-3cee-41e5-83ae-e34b0f957e45", "evaluation_run_id": "b55840b6-2f9a-40a0-9a2d-058758ffd906", "dataset_item_id": "f66dba9d-78be-4c00-b954-a9164bc7e272", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

{"question": "### Question: A statute passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President authorizes a federal agency to select a site for and to construct a monument honoring members of the capitol police force killed in the line of duty. The statute appropriates the necessary funds but provides that the funds may not be expended until both houses of Congress have adopted a concurrent resolution, not subject to presentment to the President, approving the agency's plans for the monument's location and design. Is the provision requiring further congressional approval before expenditure of the funds constitutional? ### Choices: 0) No, because decisions regarding the placement and design of government-owned structures are an exclusively executive function with which Congress may not interfere by any means. 1) No, because the provision amounts to an unconstitutional legislative interference with an executive function. 2) Yes, because Congress may attach reasonable conditions to its appropriation of funds to executive departments, and its special interest in the members of its own police force makes the provision a reasonable condition. 3) Yes, because the provision is part of a statute that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "Answer: 1) No, because the provision amounts to an unconstitutional legislative interference with an executive function.\n\nExplanation: Conditioning the expenditure of appropriated funds on a future concurrent resolution not presented to the President is an impermissible “legislative veto.” Under INS v. Chadha, any legislative action altering legal rights or obligations must satisfy bicameralism and presentment. Congress can condition appropriations by statute, but it cannot reserve to itself approval power via a concurrent resolution that bypasses presentment.", "answering_model": "openai/gpt-5", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:59:00.333204+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "10df950b-9f1a-44f8-9807-5051313f6191", "evaluation_run_id": "b55840b6-2f9a-40a0-9a2d-058758ffd906", "dataset_item_id": "5b44f5f8-458b-4152-808a-64ca044aa826", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

It was determined that the friend lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident at the time it actually occurred. The court should rule that the friend would be ### Choices: 0) competent to testify, because he had personal knowledge of the accident. 1) competent to testify, because a seven-year-old is presumed to be chronologically mature. 2) incompetent, because he lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident at the time of its occurrence. 3) incompetent, because all children under the age of 10 are deemed incompetent to testify.", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "Answer: 2) incompetent, because he lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident at the time of its occurrence.\n\nExplanation: A witness must have personal knowledge of the matter (ability to perceive and recall the event) and be able to communicate it.
