Article 38(1) does not establish a ranking system; it simply enumerates the sources the ICJ should apply.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n1. **Treaties supersede custom** - While treaties may create specific obligations between parties that override general custom (lex specialis), this doesn't mean treaties are hierarchically superior as a source.\n\n2. **Custom supersedes treaties** - Custom doesn't automatically override treaties. Both can coexist, and conflicts are resolved through principles like lex posterior (later law) or lex specialis (specific law), not hierarchy.\n\n3. **General Principles supersede both** - General principles are actually considered a subsidiary source, used to fill gaps when treaties and custom don't provide answers.\n\n**Important note:** The only exception to this \"no hierarchy\" rule is **jus cogens** (peremptory norms), which are fundamental principles that cannot be derogated from by treaty or custom.

It describes what derogations do but not the specific circumstances required.\n\n**Option 1:** \"A derogation refers to the ability of rights holders to bring a claim against the State for breach of an obligation\"\n- This is incorrect. This describes a complaint or petition mechanism, not a derogation.\n\n**Option 2:** \"A State may suspend particular rights by means of a derogation in circumstances that threaten its existence\"\n- This is the most accurate and complete answer. Derogations allow states to temporarily suspend certain (but not all) human rights obligations during public emergencies that threaten the life of the nation, as provided in treaties like the ICCPR (Article 4) and ECHR (Article 15).\n\n**Option 3:** \"Derogations are enforcement clauses in human rights treaties\"\n- This is incorrect. Enforcement clauses refer to monitoring and compliance mechanisms, not derogations.\n\nThe correct answer is **Option 2**.
