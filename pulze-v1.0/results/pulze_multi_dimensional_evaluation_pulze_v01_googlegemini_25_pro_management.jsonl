The idea of a fixed optimal number (like 5 or 7, which were suggested by early management theorists) has been replaced by a **contingency approach**.\n\nThe optimal span of control depends on several factors, including:\n\n*   **Task Complexity:** Simple, repetitive tasks allow for a wider span of control, while complex and varied tasks require a narrower span.\n*   **Employee Skill and Experience:** Highly trained, professional, and experienced employees require less supervision, allowing for a wider span.\n*   **Manager's Capabilities:** A more experienced and organized manager can handle a wider span of control.\n*   **Standardization:** The more procedures are standardized, the wider the span can be.\n*   **Technology:** Modern communication and monitoring technology can enable managers to effectively oversee more employees, thus widening the span.\n*   **Geographic Proximity:** Employees who are physically close are easier to manage than a team that is geographically dispersed.\n\nTherefore, the \"optimal\" span of control is situational and can range from very narrow (e.g., 2-4) for a team of high-level researchers to very wide (e.g., 20-30+) for a supervisor of an assembly line.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.9857142857142858, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:34:18.698498+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "671db6e1-9c07-470a-828d-e7355a20d8b0", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "29aaa24c-65f4-4632-8c2a-45416dab1dc2", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
