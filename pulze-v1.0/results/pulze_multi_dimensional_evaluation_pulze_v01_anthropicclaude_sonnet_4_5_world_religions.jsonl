This was a radical departure from traditional Egyptian polytheism.\n\nThe primary target of Akhenaten's religious reforms was **Amun**, who had become the supreme state god of Egypt, particularly powerful through the priesthood at Karnak in Thebes. Amun was often combined with Ra as Amun-Ra.\n\n**Mut** was Amun's consort and part of the Theban triad (along with their son Khonsu).\n\nHistorical evidence shows that Akhenaten:\n- Ordered the removal of Amun's name from monuments throughout Egypt\n- Closed Amun's temples\n- Redirected resources away from Amun's powerful priesthood\n- Moved the capital from Thebes (Amun's cult center) to a new city, Akhetaten\n\nWhile Akhenaten's reforms affected Egyptian religion broadly, Amun and his associated deities (including Mut) were the primary targets of systematic elimination efforts.\n\nThe answer is **2) Amun and Mut**.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.9857142857142858, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:53:57.550752+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "46039298-252a-4b50-8aed-7bafe34ff7c3", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "d4a9d725-8c45-4aaf-9be1-aa662fabf2e4", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
