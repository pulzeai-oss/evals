The p-norm is defined as:\n\n`||x||_p = (|x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + ... + |x_n|^p)^(1/p)`\n\nLet's test the parallelogram law using two simple, non-zero, orthogonal vectors in `R^2`. A good choice is the standard basis vectors:\n*   `x = (1, 0)`\n*   `y = (0, 1)`\n\nNow, let's calculate each term in the parallelogram law for the p-norm:\n\n1.  **Calculate the norms of x and y:**\n    *   `||x||_p = (|1|^p + |0|^p)^(1/p) = (1)^(1/p) = 1`\n    *   `||y||_p = (|0|^p + |1|^p)^(1/p) = (1)^(1/p) = 1`\n\n2.  **Calculate the norms of (x+y) and (x-y):**\n    *   `x + y = (1, 1)`\n    *   `||x + y||_p = (|1|^p + |1|^p)^(1/p) = (1 + 1)^(1/p) = 2^(1/p)`\n    *   `x - y = (1, -1)`\n    *   `||x - y||_p = (|1|^p + |-1|^p)^(1/p) = (1 + 1)^(1/p) = 2^(1/p)`\n\n3.  **Substitute these into the parallelogram law equation:**\n    `||x + y||_p^2 + ||x - y||_p^2 = 2(||x||_p^2 + ||y||_p^2)`\n    `[2^(1/p)]^2 + [2^(1/p)]^2 = 2(1^2 + 1^2)`\n    `2^(2/p) + 2^(2/p) = 2(1 + 1)`\n    `2 * 2^(2/p) = 2 * 2`\n    `2 * 2^(2/p) = 4`\n    `2^(2/p) = 2`\n    `2^(2/p) = 2^1`\n\n4.  **Solve for p:**\n    For the equality to hold, the exponents must be equal:\n    `2/p = 1`\n    `p = 2`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe parallelogram law only holds for the p-norm when `p = 2`.\n\n*   For **p = 2**, the norm is the standard Euclidean norm: `||x||_2 = sqrt(Σ|x_i|^2)`.

This means that the image of S is the entire space T, i.e., `f(S) = T`.\n\nCombining this with the theorem:\n1.  If `S` is a compact space,\n2.  and `f` is a continuous function,\n3.  then the image `f(S)` is compact.\n4.  Since `f` is onto, `f(S) = T`.\n5.  Therefore, `T` is compact.\n\nThis shows that the condition **\"f is continuous\"** is sufficient to ensure that T is compact.\n\n### Analyzing the Choices\n\nNow we must find the *weakest* condition among the choices that is sufficient. A condition A is weaker than a condition B if B implies A, but A does not necessarily imply B.\n\n*   **0) f is a homeomorphism:** A homeomorphism is a continuous, one-to-one, and onto function whose inverse is also continuous. Since a homeomorphism is by definition continuous, this condition is sufficient. However, it is a very strong condition, requiring more than just continuity.\n\n*   **1) f is continuous and one-to-one:** This condition includes continuity, so it is also sufficient. However, it adds the requirement of being one-to-one, making it a stronger condition than just continuity.\n\n*   **2) f is continuous:** As we've shown, this condition is sufficient.\n\n*   **3) f is one-to-one:** This condition does not mention continuity. A non-continuous function can map a compact space to a non-compact space. For example, let S = [0, 1] with the usual topology (which is compact). Let T be the set [0, 1] with the discrete topology (where every point is an open set). T is not compact. The identity map from S to T is one-to-one and onto, but T is not compact. Therefore, this condition is not sufficient.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have three sufficient conditions:\n*   f is a homeomorphism (strongest)\n*   f is continuous and one-to-one (stronger)\n*   f is continuous (weakest)\n\nThe relationship is:\n(f is a homeomorphism) ⇒ (f is continuous and one-to-one) ⇒ (f is continuous)\n\nThe question asks for the **weakest** sufficient condition.
