{"question": "### Question:  When analysing consumer lifecycles, marketers look at consumers in differing stages of their life. Many models upon which these are based were developed in the 1960s.

A decline in marriage rates means fewer households are forming based on traditional marital structures, impacting purchasing decisions related to homeownership, family planning, and joint finances.\n*   **1) People getting married at a later age:** This trend extends the \"single\" or \"pre-family\" life stage, often meaning individuals have more disposable income and established careers before marriage. This can delay or alter purchases related to starting a family or buying a first home.\n*   **2) More couples co-habiting:** Cohabitation has become a common alternative or precursor to marriage. These couples often share expenses and make joint purchasing decisions, creating a distinct household type that traditional 1960s models might not adequately capture.\n\nAll three of these trends represent fundamental shifts in how individuals form households and progress through life stages, significantly impacting consumer behavior and purchasing patterns compared to the assumptions of many older lifecycle models.
