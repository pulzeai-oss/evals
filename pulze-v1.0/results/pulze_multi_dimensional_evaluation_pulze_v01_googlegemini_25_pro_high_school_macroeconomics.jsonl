{"question": "### Question: When a large increase in aggregate demand has an even greater increase in real GDP economists refer to this as ### Choices: 0) the balanced budget multiplier. 1) the money multiplier. 2) the foreign substitution effect. 3) the spending multiplier.", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **3) the spending multiplier.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **The Spending Multiplier:** This economic concept explains how an initial change in spending (from consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports) leads to a larger final change in real GDP. The initial spending becomes income for someone, who then spends a portion of it, which becomes income for someone else, and this process continues in a ripple effect. Because of this chain reaction, the total increase in GDP is a multiple of the initial increase in spending.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **0) The balanced budget multiplier:** This refers to the specific case where an increase in government spending is matched by an equal increase in taxes. The effect on GDP is typically equal to the amount of the spending increase (a multiplier of 1), not greater.\n*   **1) The money multiplier:** This relates to the banking system and shows how an initial deposit can lead to a larger increase in the total money supply. It's about the creation of money, not the effect of spending on GDP.\n*   **2) The foreign substitution effect:** This is one of the reasons the aggregate demand curve slopes downward. It states that as the domestic price level rises, domestic goods become more expensive relative to foreign goods, causing net exports to fall.

This means one U.S. dollar can buy more of a foreign currency (e.g., more Euros, more Japanese Yen, more Mexican Pesos).\n\nLet's analyze the choices based on this fact:\n\n*   **0) Imports into the United States will decrease.** (Incorrect) A stronger dollar makes foreign goods cheaper for Americans. For example, if a French wine costs €20, and the dollar strengthens from $1=€1 to $1=€1.25, the price for an American drops from $20 to $16. Cheaper prices lead to an *increase* in imports, not a decrease.\n\n*   **1) Exports from the United States will increase.** (Incorrect) A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive for foreigners. For example, if an American-made laptop costs $1,000, a European buyer would have to pay €1,000 when the exchange rate is $1=€1, but they would have to pay €1,250 if the dollar strengthens to $1=€1.25. More expensive prices lead to a *decrease* in exports.\n\n*   **2) U.S. residents will take more vacations in foreign countries.** (Correct) This is the most likely outcome. A stronger dollar means an American's money goes further abroad. Hotel rooms, meals, and souvenirs in other countries become cheaper in dollar terms. This makes foreign travel more affordable and appealing for U.S. residents.\n\n*   **3) More foreign visitors will travel to the United States.** (Incorrect) A stronger dollar makes traveling to the U.S. more expensive for foreigners. Their currency buys fewer U.S. dollars, so everything from hotels in New York to tickets for Disney World costs them more.
