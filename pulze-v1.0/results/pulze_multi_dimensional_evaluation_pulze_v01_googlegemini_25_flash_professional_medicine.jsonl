{"question": "### Question: A male stillborn is delivered at 32 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination of the stillborn shows the absence of a urethral opening. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this stillborn? ### Choices: 0) Congenital diaphragmatic hernia 1) Intralobar sequestration 2) Pulmonary hypoplasia 3) Situs inversus", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The question describes a male stillborn at 32 weeks' gestation with oligohydramnios and an absent urethral opening. We need to identify the most likely additional finding.\n\n1.  **Absent urethral opening:** This indicates a severe obstruction of the fetal urinary tract. In a male fetus, this would lead to a buildup of urine in the bladder, ureters, and kidneys (hydronephrosis, hydroureter, megacystis).\n2.  **Oligohydramnios:** Amniotic fluid is primarily composed of fetal urine after the first trimester. A severe urinary tract obstruction prevents the fetus from excreting urine into the amniotic sac, leading to a significant reduction in amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios).\n3.  **Potter Sequence:** Severe and prolonged oligohydramnios, regardless of its cause (e.g., bilateral renal agenesis, severe obstructive uropathy like urethral atresia), leads to a constellation of findings known as Potter sequence. The key features of Potter sequence include:\n    *   **Pulmonary hypoplasia:** This is the most common and life-threatening complication. The lack of amniotic fluid prevents normal lung development, as the fluid is crucial for lung expansion and growth.\n    *   **Potter facies:** Characteristic facial features due to compression in utero (e.g., flattened nose, low-set ears, prominent epicanthal folds).\n    *   **Limb deformities:** Such as club feet, due to compression.\n    *   **Renal anomalies:** The underlying cause of the oligohydramnios (e.g., renal agenesis, severe renal dysplasia, or obstructive uropathy).\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **0) Congenital diaphragmatic hernia:** While this can cause pulmonary hypoplasia, it is a structural defect of the diaphragm and not a direct consequence of oligohydramnios or urethral atresia.\n*   **1) Intralobar sequestration:** This is a congenital malformation of the lung where a portion of lung tissue is not connected to the normal tracheobronchial tree. It is not typically associated with oligohydramnios.\n*   **2) Pulmonary hypoplasia:** This is a direct and very common consequence of severe and prolonged oligohydramnios, as the lack of amniotic fluid impairs normal lung development. This is a hallmark feature of Potter sequence and the most common cause of death in such cases.\n*   **3) Situs inversus:** This is a condition where the major visceral organs are reversed from their normal positions. It is a developmental anomaly but not directly linked to oligohydramnios or urethral atresia.\n\nGiven the severe urinary tract obstruction leading to oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia is the most expected and critical additional finding due to the impaired lung development in the absence of adequate amniotic fluid.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:52:12.085233+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "4dd9c4be-949a-4dda-945a-724fefc93bb2", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "5fc8a0fb-7a2c-481f-9f8f-e2e622772f32", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

While useful, they are typically not the *initial* imaging modality. They are often performed if TSH is suppressed (to rule out a hyperfunctioning nodule, which is rarely malignant) or after an ultrasound has characterized the nodule. They do not provide the detailed anatomical information needed to guide further management as effectively as ultrasound.\n\n*   **2) fine-needle aspiration (FNA):** FNA is the gold standard for obtaining a cytological diagnosis of a thyroid nodule and determining the risk of malignancy. However, FNA is usually performed *after* an ultrasound has characterized the nodule, determined its size, location, and identified any suspicious features that would warrant aspiration. Ultrasound guidance is also often used during the FNA procedure. Therefore, it's not the *initial* method to investigate the lesion's characteristics.\n\n*   **3) ultrasonography of the thyroid gland:** Ultrasonography is the **most appropriate initial imaging modality** for evaluating a thyroid nodule.

{"question": "### Question: A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle? ### Choices: 0) G0 1) G1 2) G2 3) M", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **1) G1**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Role of p53:** The p53 gene (TP53) is a critical tumor suppressor gene. It acts as the \"guardian of the genome.\" When DNA damage occurs (as caused by radiation therapy), active p53 protein:\n    *   Induces cell cycle arrest to allow for DNA repair.\n    *   If the damage is too severe, it triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death).\n\n2.  **p53 and G1 arrest:** One of the primary mechanisms by which p53 induces cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage is at the **G1/S checkpoint**.\n    *   Upon DNA damage, p53 levels increase and it activates the transcription of genes like p21.\n    *   p21 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. It binds to and inactivates cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin D/CDK4/6 complexes, which are essential for progression from G1 into S phase.\n    *   This inhibition prevents the cell from replicating its damaged DNA, giving time for repair.\n\n3.  **Impact of inactive p53:** If p53 is mutated and inactive, as described in the question, the cell loses this critical checkpoint control.\n    *   When radiation therapy damages the DNA of the tumor cells, the inactive p53 cannot trigger the G1 arrest.\n    *   Consequently, the cells with damaged DNA proceed through the G1 phase, enter S phase (DNA replication), and continue to divide, accumulating more mutations and leading to progressive tumor growth despite the therapy.\n\n4.  **Other phases:**\n    *   **G0:** This is a quiescent state, not an arrest point *in response to DNA damage* for actively dividing cells.\n    *   **G2:** While p53 can also influence the G2/M checkpoint, the G1/S checkpoint is the most prominent and direct p53-mediated arrest point for DNA damage *before* DNA replication. Other proteins like ATM/ATR and Chk1/Chk2 are also heavily involved in G2 arrest.\n    *   **M:** Arrest during M phase (mitosis) is primarily regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint, which ensures proper chromosome segregation, not directly by DNA damage in the same way as G1 or G2.\n\nTherefore, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy in a patient with inactive p53 is most directly related to a defect in cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:59:35.804901+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "15bf751a-5c01-4ae9-8218-0414be114cdd", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "f5a96924-5390-435d-8195-1284001bb7f7", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: A 64-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of increasing shortness of breath, sore throat, and a cough productive of a small amount of white phlegm. Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled β-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following? ### Choices: 0) Mesothelioma 1) Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast 2) Multiple endocrine neoplasia 3) Non-small cell lung carcinoma", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a significant smoking history (44 pack-years), which is the leading risk factor for lung cancer. She presents with classic symptoms of lung cancer, including increasing shortness of breath, cough, and a concerning 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss over the past year.\n\nKey findings supporting a diagnosis of lung cancer:\n1.  **Smoking history:** 44 pack-years is a very high risk factor for lung cancer.\n2.  **Symptoms:** Shortness of breath, cough, and unexplained weight loss are common presenting symptoms of lung malignancy.\n3.  **Physical examination:** A 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area (Virchow's node) is highly suggestive of metastatic disease, often originating from the chest or abdomen.\n4.  **Chest X-ray and CT scan:** A large right lower lobe mass (7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm) is a primary lung lesion. The presence of scattered calcifications can occur in some lung cancers, though it's more common in benign lesions.\n5.  **Lymphadenopathy:** Right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes indicate regional spread of the cancer.\n6.  **Distant metastasis:** A 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland is highly suspicious for distant metastasis, a common site for lung cancer spread.\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **0) Mesothelioma:** Mesothelioma is a cancer of the pleura, usually associated with asbestos exposure. While it can cause shortness of breath and chest pain, the imaging describes a \"right lower lobe mass\" (parenchymal) rather than a pleural thickening or effusion, and there is no mention of asbestos exposure. This makes it less likely than primary lung cancer.\n*   **1) Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast:** While breast cancer can metastasize to the lungs, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands, the primary lesion is described as a \"right lower lobe mass,\" implying a primary lung tumor. Without a known primary breast cancer, and given the patient's heavy smoking history, a primary lung cancer is far more likely to be the origin of the lung mass. If it were a metastasis, the biopsy would show adenocarcinoma consistent with breast origin, but the question asks what the biopsy of the *lung mass* is *most likely* to show, implying the primary pathology of that mass.\n*   **2) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN):** MEN syndromes are genetic disorders involving tumors in multiple endocrine glands. While an adrenal mass is present, there are no other features suggestive of MEN (e.g., other endocrine tumors, family history). The primary presentation of a large lung mass with extensive lymphadenopathy and adrenal metastasis in a heavy smoker is not typical for MEN.\n*   **3) Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC):** This is the most appropriate diagnosis. NSCLC encompasses adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, which are the most common types of lung cancer. All these types are strongly associated with smoking. The clinical presentation (symptoms, weight loss, supraclavicular node), imaging findings (large lung mass, extensive lymphadenopathy, adrenal metastasis), and the patient's heavy smoking history are all highly characteristic of advanced NSCLC.\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence, a biopsy of the lung mass is most likely to show Non-small cell lung carcinoma.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:00:47.913526+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "0d10ca4f-07b1-4017-8538-646693c01908", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "6042916f-a4ca-4595-a515-a69fa4b32790", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Let's break down the key features:\n\n1.  **Age:** 14 years old, an age group commonly affected by infectious mononucleosis.\n2.  **Fatigue:** A 1-week history of progressive fatigue is a hallmark symptom of infectious mononucleosis, often preceding other acute symptoms.\n3.  **Sore Throat and Fever:** 2-day history of sore throat and fever (39°C / 102.2°F), which are common acute symptoms.\n4.  **Physical Examination Findings:**\n    *   **Cervical lymphadenopathy:** Swollen lymph nodes in the neck are a classic finding in infectious mononucleosis.\n    *   **Pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate:** While often associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, an exudative pharyngitis can also be seen in infectious mononucleosis, sometimes making differentiation difficult without testing.\n5.  **Sexual History:** Recent unprotected sexual intercourse is noted. While this raises concerns for sexually transmitted infections, the current symptom complex (especially the prominent fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and exudative pharyngitis) is not typical for common STIs like gonorrhea or chlamydia pharyngitis, which usually don't present with such systemic fatigue and prominent lymphadenopathy.

While a creamy exudate is mentioned, the overall picture of high fever, significant fatigue, and prominent lymphadenopathy in an otherwise healthy-appearing adolescent does not primarily point to candidiasis.\n*   **1) Herpangina:** Caused by coxsackievirus, herpangina is characterized by small, painful vesicles and ulcers on the soft palate, tonsillar pillars, and uvula, not typically a creamy exudate. It's also more common in younger children.\n*   **2) Infectious mononucleosis:** This diagnosis fits perfectly with the patient's presentation:\n    *   **Age:** Common in adolescents.\n    *   **Fatigue:** Prominent and often prolonged.\n    *   **Fever, sore throat, cervical lymphadenopathy:** Classic triad.\n    *   **Exudative pharyngitis:** Can occur, mimicking strep throat.\n    *   **Transmission:** Primarily through saliva (\"kissing disease\"), which can be relevant in a sexually active adolescent.\n*   **3) Mumps:** Mumps is characterized by painful swelling of the salivary glands (parotitis), which is not mentioned in the physical examination. While fever and fatigue can occur, the defining feature of mumps is absent, and pharyngeal exudate and prominent cervical lymphadenopathy are not typical primary findings.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of progressive fatigue, fever, sore throat with exudate, and cervical lymphadenopathy in an adolescent is highly characteristic of infectious mononucleosis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:02:05.247083+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "ed151434-ace0-4e9e-9192-1f3d31e8b89f", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "8e8f3a60-de06-4e8d-b845-df0cfa47ac03", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
