{"question": "### Question:  When analysing consumer lifecycles, marketers look at consumers in differing stages of their life. Many models upon which these are based were developed in the 1960s. Since then a lot has changed in 'consumer lifecycles'.

However, modern society has evolved significantly, and marketers must account for several emerging trends:\n\n### 1. **Fewer people are getting married**\n- Marriage rates have declined substantially in many developed countries\n- More people are choosing to remain single throughout their lives\n- This creates a larger, more permanent single consumer segment with different needs and purchasing patterns\n\n### 2. **People getting married at a later age**\n- The average age of first marriage has increased significantly since the 1960s\n- This extends the \"young single\" phase and delays family formation\n- Consumers have more time for education, career development, and different consumption priorities before marriage\n\n### 3. **More couples co-habiting**\n- Cohabitation without marriage has become increasingly common and socially accepted\n- These households have different legal, financial, and consumption patterns than married couples\n- They may have similar purchasing needs to married couples but different attitudes toward long-term commitments\n\n### Marketing Implications:\n\nThese trends mean marketers must:\n- Segment markets more carefully beyond traditional family structures\n- Recognize diverse household compositions\n- Avoid assumptions about \"typical\" life progression\n- Develop products and messaging for non-traditional lifecycles\n\n**Answer: 3) All of the above**", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:24:52.254042+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "e5fd0c77-6e30-4391-b22b-ee6a5d472340", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "ca275ada-6f8a-4baf-9944-1134c1286ad1", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

This matches the description perfectly - exclusive rights + defined territory + very limited intermediaries.\n\n**Intensive distribution**: This aims to place products in as many outlets as possible (e.g., convenience goods in every store). This uses many intermediaries, not limited ones.\n\n**Selective distribution**: This uses more than one but fewer than all possible intermediaries.
