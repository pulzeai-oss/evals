An advantage of larger pages is that they lead to smaller page tables.**\n*   **Explanation:** A page table contains an entry for each virtual page. If the page size is larger, the total number of pages required to cover a given virtual address space is smaller. Fewer pages mean fewer entries in the page table, thus a smaller page table. This reduces the memory required for the page table itself and can improve TLB hit rates (as fewer unique page table entries might be needed for a given working set).\n*   **Conclusion:** This statement is **true**.\n\n**II. An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation.**\n*   **Explanation:** Internal fragmentation occurs when a process is allocated a block of memory (a page frame) that is larger than the actual memory it needs. The unused portion within that block is wasted. On average, a process will waste about half a page in its last allocated page frame. If the page size is smaller, this \"half-page\" waste is also smaller in absolute terms. For example, if a process needs 4097 bytes:\n    *   With 4KB (4096 bytes) pages, it needs 2 pages, wasting 4095 bytes in the second page.\n    *   With 1KB (1024 bytes) pages, it needs 5 pages, wasting 1023 bytes in the fifth page.\n    *   The average waste per process is roughly (page_size / 2). So, smaller pages lead to less internal fragmentation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This statement is **true**.\n\n**III. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously.**\n*   **Explanation:** Disk access time is composed of three main parts:\n    1.  **Seek time:** Time to move the disk arm to the correct track. This is largely independent of the amount of data being read/written.\n    2.  **Rotational latency:** Time for the desired sector to rotate under the read/write head. This is also largely independent of the amount of data.\n    3.  **Transfer time:** Time to actually read or write the data. This *is* directly proportional to the amount of data (page length).\n*   For typical page sizes (e.g., 4KB, 8KB), the seek time and rotational latency often constitute the dominant portion of the total disk access time. These are fixed overheads. If you fetch a larger page (longer page), you pay these fixed overheads once but transfer more data. This amortizes the fixed overhead over a larger amount of data, leading to a higher effective data transfer rate (more data transferred per unit of I/O operation). Therefore, longer pages can be advantageous for disk I/O efficiency.\n*   **Conclusion:** This statement is **true**.\n\nSince all three statements are true considerations for choosing page size, the correct choice is the one that includes I, II, and III.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:21:45.455019+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "67865ed8-0f0e-4532-ac31-4a93e0ad3ec7", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "1a8f1805-576c-44f8-b7bf-4036bc958d1c", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.**\n*   In any binary search tree, the search time is proportional to the height of the tree.\n*   A height-balanced binary search tree (like an AVL tree or Red-Black tree) is specifically designed to ensure that its height `h` is always `O(log N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes. This prevents the tree from degenerating into a linked list, which would have a height of `O(N)`.\n*   Since the height is `O(log N)`, the worst-case search time (which occurs when the target node is at the deepest level or not present) is also `O(log N)`.\n*   **This statement is TRUE.**\n\n**II. Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.**\n*   For a randomly constructed BST, the average height is `O(log N)`, leading to an average search time of `O(log N)`.\n*   For a height-balanced BST, the height is *guaranteed* to be `O(log N)` even in the worst case. Therefore, its average-case search time will also be `O(log N)`.
