The particle travels a distance $d$ under the influence of this electric field.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the equation of motion for a charged particle in a uniform electric field.\nThe force on the particle due to the electric field is given by $F = QE$. The acceleration of the particle is $a = \\frac{F}{m} = \\frac{QE}{m}$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the motion of the particle.\nSince the electric field is uniform, the acceleration is constant. We can use the equations of motion to describe the particle's trajectory. The distance traveled by the particle before it stops or changes direction can be determined using the equation $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$, where $v$ is the final velocity (0, if it stops), $u$ is the initial velocity, $a$ is the acceleration, and $s$ is the distance traveled.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the equation of motion to the initial condition.\nFor the initial condition, $0 = V^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{QE}{m}\\right)d$, because the acceleration is opposite to the direction of the initial velocity.
