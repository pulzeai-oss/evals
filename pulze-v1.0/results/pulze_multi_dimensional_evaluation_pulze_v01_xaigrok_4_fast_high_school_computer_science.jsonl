{"question": "### Question: Which of the following is the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 231_{10} ? ### Choices: 0) 17_{16} 1) E4_{16} 2) E7_{16} 3) F4_{16}", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "C) E7_{16}\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe task requires converting the decimal number 231 to hexadecimal, which is base 16 and uses digits 0-9 along with A-F for values 10-15. To perform the conversion, divide the decimal number by 16 and record the remainders, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nFirst, divide 231 by 16: 231 ÷ 16 = 14 with a remainder of 7 (since 16 × 14 = 224 and 231 - 224 = 7). The remainder 7 is the least significant digit.\n\nNext, take the quotient 14, which is already less than 16, so it becomes the next digit. In hexadecimal, 14 is represented as E.\n\nThus, the hexadecimal equivalent is E7_{16}.\n\nTo verify, convert E7_{16} back to decimal: E (14) × 16^1 + 7 × 16^0 = 14 × 16 + 7 = 224 + 7 = 231, confirming the conversion is correct.\n\nFor the choices:  \n- A) 17_{16} = 1 × 16 + 7 = 23, which is less than 231.  \n- B) E4_{16} = 14 × 16 + 4 = 228, which is close but less than 231.  \n- C) E7_{16} = 231, matching exactly.  \n- D) F4_{16} = 15 × 16 + 4 = 244, which is greater than 231.  \n\nThis process identifies C as the correct option.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.97, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:51:18.234247+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "7781c509-7acb-47de-b2a2-05106658805b", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "975d2e66-e0bd-4ab3-9c1c-699672de4ada", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}
{"question": "### Question: Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.\n\n For example, if 1istl contains\n [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\"]\n and 1ist2 contains\n [\"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula, \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"],\n then newList will contain\n [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"].\n\n The following procedures are available to create newList.\n Procedure\n Explanation\n Sort (list)\n Sorts list in alphabetical order and returns the resulting list.\n Combine (listl, list2)\n Creates a new list consisting of the entries from\n list1 followed by the entries from list2.

The procedures—Sort, Combine, and RemoveDuplicates—must be applied in an order that first gathers all entries, then eliminates duplicates, and finally ensures alphabetical ordering.\n\nFor the example inputs—list1 = [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\"] and list2 = [\"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"]—the desired output is [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"].\n\n- Choice 0: Combine(list1, list2) creates [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"]. Sort(newList) rearranges it to [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\", \"Macbeth\"]. RemoveDuplicates(newList) then removes the duplicates, resulting in [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"], which matches the required output. This sequence correctly handles both duplicates and sorting.\n\n- Choice 1: Sorting list1 and list2 individually produces sorted versions, but Combine(list1, list2) yields [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\", \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\"]. RemoveDuplicates(newList) removes duplicates while preserving the combined order, resulting in [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\", \"Dracula\", \"Hamlet\"], which is not fully sorted.\n\n- Choice 2: RemoveDuplicates on each list has no effect here since both are already unique internally. Combine(list1, list2) creates the unsorted list with cross-duplicates: [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"]. Sort(newList) then produces [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\", \"Macbeth\"], which still contains duplicates.\n\n- Choice 3: RemoveDuplicates and Sort on each list individually result in sorted unique versions: list1 = [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"] and list2 = [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\"]. Combine(list1, list2) yields [\"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\", \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\"], which has duplicates and is not sorted overall.\n\nOnly Choice 0 achieves the correct result by combining all entries first, sorting the full list, and then removing duplicates, ensuring uniqueness and alphabetical order.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:55:05.304341+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "243d0bdd-6ccd-4bed-81f7-047e61345cb0", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "36b3f910-07fd-4272-a6e3-5593bb764d95", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}

Which of the following questions is LEAST likely to be answerable using the trends feature? ### Choices: 0) In what month does a particular sport receive the most searches? 1) In which political candidates are people interested? 2) What is the cost of a certain electronics product? 3) Which region of the country has the greatest number of people searching for opera performances?", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "2) What is the cost of a certain electronics product?\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe trends feature tracks the popularity of search terms, allowing filters by geographic region, date, and specific categories such as arts and entertainment, computers and electronics, games, news, people and society, shopping, sports, and travel.

The trends feature only shows how often the product is searched for—potentially under the computers and electronics or shopping categories—but does not provide cost data, making this unanswerable.\n\nFor option 3, identifying the region with the most searches for opera performances can be determined by filtering search volume by geographic region within the arts and entertainment category.\n\nThus, option 2 is least likely to be answerable, as it demands content beyond search popularity metrics.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:58:33.075634+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "39b5331a-1a50-4d0d-9f62-da8961f0698d", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "ecf587c7-7632-479f-af75-8a4088ecf737", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
