The term \"kinase\" comes from their function of phosphorylating substrates.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n0) \"inhibit ATP breakdown\" - This is not correct. Kinases actually USE ATP as a phosphate donor. They facilitate the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a substrate, which does involve ATP breakdown (ATP → ADP + Pi), but they don't inhibit it - they catalyze it.\n\n1) \"involve the addition or removal of a phosphate group\" - This is correct. Kinases specifically catalyze phosphorylation reactions, which involve the addition of a phosphate group from ATP (or sometimes other nucleotide triphosphates) to a substrate molecule. While kinases primarily ADD phosphate groups (phosphatases remove them), the statement about addition is definitely correct.\n\n2) \"involve the addition or removal of a ketone group\" - This is incorrect. Kinases don't work with ketone groups.\n\n3) \"involve the addition or removal of an amino acid to a polypeptide chain\" - This is incorrect.
