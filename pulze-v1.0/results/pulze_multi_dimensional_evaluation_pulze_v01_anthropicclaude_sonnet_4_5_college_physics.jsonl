The key characteristic is that both the system and surroundings can be returned to their initial states without any net change in the universe.\n\nLet me evaluate each choice:\n\n**Choice 0: \"There are no changes in the internal energy of the system.\"**\n- False. Internal energy can change in reversible processes. For example, in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, heat flows in and work is done, but internal energy stays constant only because temperature is constant. In a reversible adiabatic process, internal energy definitely changes.\n\n**Choice 1: \"The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.\"**\n- False. Only isothermal processes maintain constant temperature. Reversible adiabatic processes, for instance, involve temperature changes.\n\n**Choice 2: \"The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\"**\n- **True**.
