They are touching other cubes. Since these internal surfaces are no longer part of the *outer* surface, the total combined surface area has been reduced.\n\nIn general, for a given volume of material, the surface area is minimized when the material is in a single, compact shape (like a sphere) and maximized when it is broken up into many small pieces.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:13:53.224877+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "d83cf7d1-2f47-48a2-be41-fee119492268", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "fbf2c3b0-eaee-4bb4-9892-4bfad6f8458e", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Protons are positively charged, while neutrons have no charge. The electrical force (also known as the electrostatic or Coulomb force) acts between charged particles. Since all the protons in the nucleus have the same positive charge, they repel each other. This repulsive electrical force tends to push the protons, and therefore the nucleus, apart.\n\nIt is the **strong nuclear force**, a different and much stronger force, that overcomes this electrical repulsion and holds the nucleus together.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:18:10.401679+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "78f4ffd1-6d16-495f-8ae6-260917862562", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "fa209114-ccb5-4ba8-9ea7-ef392e4b91c7", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: When a fusion reaction converts a pair of hydrogen isotopes to an alpha particle and a neutron most of the energy released is in the form of ### Choices: 0) gamma radiation. 1) kinetic energy of the alpha particle. 2) kinetic energy of the neutron. 3) All of these about equally.", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the correct answer:\n\n1.  **The Reaction:** The question describes the most common fusion reaction studied for power generation, the Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) reaction:\n    *   Deuterium (²H) + Tritium (³H) → Alpha Particle (⁴He) + Neutron (n)\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy:** In this reaction, a small amount of mass is converted into a large amount of energy (E=mc²). This energy is released as the kinetic energy of the products (the alpha particle and the neutron). The total energy released is approximately 17.6 million electron volts (MeV).\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Let's assume the initial hydrogen isotopes are nearly stationary, so the initial momentum of the system is zero. According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum after the reaction must also be zero.\n    *   This means the alpha particle and the neutron must fly off in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.\n    *   Momentum (p) = mass (m) × velocity (v)\n    *   So, p(alpha) = -p(neutron)\n\n4.  **Kinetic Energy Distribution:** Kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula KE = ½mv². We can also express it in terms of momentum: KE = p² / 2m.\n    *   Since the magnitudes of the momenta (p) are equal for both particles, their kinetic energies are inversely proportional to their masses.\n    *   KE ∝ 1/m\n\n5.  **Comparing Masses:**\n    *   An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so its mass is approximately 4 atomic mass units (amu).\n    *   A neutron has a mass of approximately 1 amu.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Because the neutron is much lighter than the alpha particle (about 1/4 the mass), it must travel much faster to have the same momentum. This means the lighter particle gets the vast majority of the kinetic energy.\n    *   The energy is split roughly in proportion to the inverse of their masses. The neutron gets about 4/5 of the energy, and the alpha particle gets about 1/5.\n    *   Specifically, of the 17.6 MeV released:\n        *   The neutron carries away ~14.1 MeV.\n        *   The alpha particle carries away ~3.5 MeV.\n\nTherefore, most of the energy is released in the form of the kinetic energy of the neutron.\n\nThe correct choice is **2) kinetic energy of the neutron.**", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:21:07.778927+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "93a9746c-4b03-47a8-af3c-b327bef28b48", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "6237f580-af79-4064-a586-2ac59ee71c74", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
