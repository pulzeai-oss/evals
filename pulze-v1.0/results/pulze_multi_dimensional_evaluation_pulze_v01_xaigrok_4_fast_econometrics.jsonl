When autocorrelation is present, OLS estimators remain unbiased and consistent, meaning the coefficient estimates (i) are not systematically misleading in terms of their expected values, though they may be inefficient due to higher variance.\n\nNext, consider the implications for hypothesis testing (ii). Autocorrelation leads to biased standard errors, typically underestimated, which inflates t-statistics and F-statistics. This results in hypothesis tests that are invalid, increasing the likelihood of incorrect conclusions, such as falsely rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nFor forecasts (iii), the point forecasts derived from OLS coefficients are unbiased because the coefficients themselves are unbiased estimators of the true parameters. Thus, forecasts are not inherently biased, though their reliability may be affected by the inefficiency of the estimates.\n\nFinally, evaluate standard errors (iv). Autocorrelation violates the homoskedasticity and independence assumptions, causing the OLS standard errors to be inappropriate—usually too small—which undermines confidence intervals and other inference tools.\n\nBased on this analysis, only statements (ii) and (iv) hold as likely consequences, corresponding to choice 0.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:20:34.743924+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "98ce6740-b90b-4333-9b71-7d267077f4ff", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "038ee7aa-f52c-46ce-8f66-744868ea9c5c", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
