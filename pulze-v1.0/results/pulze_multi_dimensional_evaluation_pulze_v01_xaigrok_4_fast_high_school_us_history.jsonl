{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\n\"Yesterday, December 7, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing…the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack….The attack yesterday…has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas….As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\"\nPresident Franklin D.

{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\n\"If you analyze it I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism. I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals—if we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is. Now, I can't say that I will agree with all the things that the present group who call themselves Libertarians in the sense of a party say, because I think that like in any political movement there are shades, and there are libertarians who are almost over at the point of wanting no government at all or anarchy. I believe there are legitimate government functions. There is a legitimate need in an orderly society for some government to maintain freedom or we will have tyranny by individuals. The strongest man on the block will run the neighborhood. We have government to ensure that we don't each one of us have to carry a club to defend ourselves. But again, I stand on my statement that I think that libertarianism and conservatism are traveling the same path.\"\nRonald Reagan, Interview published in Reason magazine, 1975\nWhich of the following groups would be most opposed to the sentiments expressed in the excerpt above? ### Choices: 0) Neoconservatives 1) Reagan Democrats 2) Progressive Liberals 3) Populists", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "2) Progressive Liberals\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe excerpt from Ronald Reagan emphasizes limited government, reduced centralized authority, and greater individual freedom, aligning with libertarian principles while acknowledging minimal government roles for maintaining order. To identify the group most opposed, evaluate each option based on their typical ideological stances:\n\n- Neoconservatives generally support a strong national defense and interventionist foreign policy, which may involve expanded government roles abroad, but they often align with conservative domestic policies favoring free markets and limited intervention, making them less directly opposed to Reagan's core sentiments.\n\n- Reagan Democrats, as working-class supporters of Reagan's 1980s policies, were drawn to his emphasis on economic growth, patriotism, and reduced government overreach, indicating alignment rather than opposition.\n\n- Progressive Liberals advocate for expansive government intervention through social welfare programs, regulations, and centralized authority to address inequality and promote public goods, directly conflicting with Reagan's call for less interference and more individual freedom.\n\n- Populists vary across left and right but often support government action to protect ordinary people from elites or corporations, which could partially overlap with limited government views; however, their focus on empowering the masses does not consistently oppose Reagan's framework as strongly as progressive ideals do.\n\nThus, Progressive Liberals represent the clearest opposition, as their preference for active government contradicts the excerpt's advocacy for minimal state involvement.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:27:47.318511+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "55be5e07-59a6-48a5-9576-a33beae9e18d", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "2f63b5c3-128d-4387-8ebb-3c38483535ee", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
