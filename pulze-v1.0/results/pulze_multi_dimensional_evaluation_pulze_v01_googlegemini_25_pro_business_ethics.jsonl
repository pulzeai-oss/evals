{"question": "### Question: Managers are entrusted to run the company in the best interest of ________. Specifically, they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company, as well as a duty of ________ and of _______. ### Choices: 0) Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence 1) Stakeholder, Care and Skill, Diligence 2) Shareholders, Self-interest, Diligence 3) Stakeholders, Care and skill, Self-interest", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **0**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Shareholders:** In traditional corporate governance (especially in the U.S.), managers and the board of directors have a primary fiduciary duty to the owners of the company, who are the shareholders. Their main goal is to maximize shareholder value. While modern business ethics increasingly emphasizes a broader responsibility to all *stakeholders* (employees, customers, community, etc.), the legal and traditional framework centers on shareholders.\n*   **Duty of Care and Skill:** This is a fundamental fiduciary duty. It requires managers to act with the same level of care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in a similar position. This involves making informed decisions and acting competently.\n*   **Duty of Diligence:** This is often considered part of the duty of care. It means managers must be attentive, persistent, and dedicated in performing their responsibilities.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they include \"Self-interest,\" which is the opposite of a manager's fiduciary duty (which is a duty of loyalty, not self-interest).", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:31:37.293780+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "4f8fdcea-b830-4534-b3a8-709aa3a1bb3f", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "8b916f7d-a089-4b29-a465-75104086dca9", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

For example, laws against murder, theft, and fraud are rooted in the ethical belief that these actions are wrong.\n*   **Not Equivalent:** The two are not the same.\n    *   **Something can be legal but unethical:** For example, finding a legal loophole to avoid paying taxes or selling a product that is known to be of poor quality but isn't technically defective might be legal, but many would consider it unethical.\n    *   **Something can be ethical but illegal:** For example, civil disobedience (like protesting an unjust law) is often done for ethical reasons but is, by definition, illegal.\n\nIn essence, the law often represents the minimum standard of behavior that a society will tolerate, while ethics often calls for a higher standard.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:12:24.703317+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "e37092b6-9068-494c-beb1-36379595f565", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "ef499a39-05b5-4005-a8f8-88b686533f38", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
