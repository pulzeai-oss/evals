Numerous studies have demonstrated a very high rate of diabetes remission or significant improvement following the procedure.\n\n*   **High Remission Rates:** Large-scale studies and meta-analyses have consistently shown that bariatric surgery leads to the remission of type 2 diabetes in a vast majority of patients. The exact percentage can vary depending on the type of surgery (e.g., gastric bypass is generally more effective than gastric banding), the duration of the diabetes, and other patient factors.\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** The figure of **80-90%** remission or improvement is widely cited in medical literature and by organizations like the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS). This means that 8 to 9 out of 10 patients will see their blood sugar levels return to normal or near-normal levels, often allowing them to stop taking diabetes medications.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:42:52.773577+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a1ebcf65-3fea-48f1-9c1f-bfd81ce582f0", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "2b0461e7-d69f-4421-90d6-b040c820b850", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

However, numerous large-scale, randomized clinical trials have conclusively shown that Vitamin E supplementation **does not prevent** cardiovascular disease and may even be harmful at high doses.\n\n*   **Vitamin K:** There is some emerging research suggesting that Vitamin K2 may play a role in preventing arterial calcification.

{"question": "### Question: Crohn's disease:\n ### Choices: 0) Always affects the colon 1) May lead to intestinal obstruction 2) Is best treated surgically 3) Requires a gluten free diet", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **1) May lead to intestinal obstruction**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **1) May lead to intestinal obstruction:** This is correct. The chronic inflammation in Crohn's disease affects the entire thickness of the bowel wall. Over time, this can lead to scarring and the formation of strictures (a narrowing of the intestine), which can block the passage of food and waste, causing an obstruction.\n\n*   **0) Always affects the colon:** This is incorrect. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. While the colon is often involved, the most common site is the end of the small intestine (the terminal ileum).\n\n*   **2) Is best treated surgically:** This is incorrect. The primary treatment for Crohn's disease is medical management with medications like anti-inflammatories, immunomodulators, and biologics. Surgery is reserved for complications like obstructions, fistulas, or abscesses that do not respond to medication.\n\n*   **3) Requires a gluten free diet:** This is incorrect. A gluten-free diet is the required treatment for celiac disease, not Crohn's disease. While some individuals with Crohn's may find that certain foods, including those with gluten, worsen their symptoms, it is not a standard or required treatment for the disease itself.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:52:01.250354+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "09acf292-2ed2-406c-baaa-350f7879c9f9", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "896df2fb-83b6-4270-b3fb-9ec1b5dacd36", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

While FADH2 is an electron carrier, it is primarily involved in catabolic (breaking down) reactions like the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the citric acid cycle.\n*   **3) Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Its coenzyme form, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), is essential for amino acid metabolism (e.g., transamination reactions).", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:53:57.555198+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "70d17b50-a6a9-45a8-89c4-d2ba189ea142", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "28b04145-1266-4aed-95de-9e280b7acc86", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
