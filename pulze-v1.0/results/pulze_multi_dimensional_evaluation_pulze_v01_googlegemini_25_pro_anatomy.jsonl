The neural pathway that carries these motor commands from the cortex to the spinal cord is called the **corticospinal tract**.\n\nA key feature of this tract is that the majority of its fibers (about 85-90%) cross over to the opposite side of the body in the medulla oblongata, an event known as the **pyramidal decussation**.\n\nBecause of this crossing over, the primary motor cortex in the left cerebral hemisphere controls the muscles on the right side of the body, and the right motor cortex controls the muscles on the left side. This is referred to as **contralateral** control.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:16:29.879380+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "00b206b7-f93c-4b39-aa61-7f4f40c202a5", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "642d566d-93c0-4e30-8040-1646e38242a6", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

The neural tube is the precursor to the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).\n*   **1) Ectomesenchymal cells:** These are mesenchymal cells that originate from the neural crest. The neural crest itself is a unique population of cells that arises from the ectoderm at the border of the neural plate. These cells are critical for forming the bones, cartilage, and connective tissues of the face and skull.\n*   **2) Dental enamel:** Enamel is the hard, outer layer of the teeth. It is produced by cells called ameloblasts, which are derived from the oral ectoderm (the surface ectoderm lining the mouth).", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:19:38.182963+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "40acad67-5c96-4587-a8bb-9ca2d9961e1d", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "5dcedbfd-b50b-4ed9-b15a-3d9d8a539fdc", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Mucous membranes line all body cavities that open to the exterior, including the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts. They serve as a primary defense by:\n    *   Acting as a physical barrier.\n    *   Trapping pathogens (like bacteria) in sticky mucus.\n    *   Containing antimicrobial substances like lysozyme and antibodies.\n\nThe other options are either too specific or incorrect:\n\n*   **0) Hair in the nose:** This is a defense mechanism, but it's a very specific part of the larger respiratory system's defenses, which are lined by mucous membranes. It primarily filters larger particles.\n*   **2) Osteoblasts:** These are cells responsible for bone formation and have no direct role in defending against environmental bacteria.\n*   **3) Saliva:** Saliva contains antibacterial enzymes and helps wash away microbes from the mouth.
