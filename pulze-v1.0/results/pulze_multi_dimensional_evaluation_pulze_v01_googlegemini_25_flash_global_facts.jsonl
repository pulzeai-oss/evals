Many dismissed the reports as wartime propaganda or exaggerations.\n\nA poll conducted in December 1942 (close to 1943) found that 47% of Americans believed that Hitler was systematically murdering Jews. However, other polls and historical analyses suggest that belief in the *full scale* of the extermination (millions of deaths) was much lower. For instance, a 1944 poll found that only 30% of Americans believed that the Nazis had murdered more than 2 million Jews, which was a significant underestimation of the actual numbers even at that time. The full extent of the Holocaust only became widely accepted and understood after the war, with the liberation of concentration camps and subsequent investigations.\n\nGiven the options, 30% best reflects the limited belief in the full scope of the Holocaust among Americans in 1943.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.73, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:17:22.329482+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "d9078288-a3e6-4198-b60d-ee31ac1b3e5c", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "5849abda-cbd3-4124-ae04-7e9fc84e5394", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 0, "clarity": 9, "completeness": 8, "conciseness": 7, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 7}

Many studies have found no evidence of an inverted U, or even evidence of a U-shape (inequality falling and then rising again, as seen in many developed countries since the 1980s). The consensus among economists and development researchers as of 2020 is that the Kuznets curve is not a robust empirical regularity and that inequality trends are more complex, influenced by a multitude of factors including policy choices, technological change, and globalization, rather than a deterministic path of development.\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis has been **generally repudiated by empirical studies**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.829, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:35:52.552350+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "bb6cabc0-e61e-4b98-9aa8-7c8af53d5a49", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "f01ac455-0aa5-4159-83ea-f4e4a696d693", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 5, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 8, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 7}
