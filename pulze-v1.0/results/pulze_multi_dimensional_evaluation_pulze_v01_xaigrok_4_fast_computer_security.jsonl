{"question": "### Question: Suppose that Alice and Bob sent confidential text messages to one another last month through an encrypted messaging system. Alice and Bob are worried that an adversary might compromise one of their computers today, while they are taking the 6.858 final exam, and would then be able to decrypt those messages. Which of the following security properties can address Alice and Bob’s concern? ### Choices: 0) Authentication. 1) Deniability. 2) Forward secrecy 3) Backward secrecy.", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "2) Forward secrecy\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning process starts by analyzing the problem: Alice and Bob sent encrypted messages last month and are concerned about an adversary compromising their computers today, potentially allowing decryption of those past messages. The goal is to identify the security property that prevents this scenario.\n\nNext, the definitions of the options are considered:  \n- Authentication verifies the sender's identity and message integrity but does not protect against decryption of past messages via key compromise.  \n- Deniability allows a party to plausibly deny involvement in a communication, which is unrelated to key security or decryption risks.  \n- Forward secrecy ensures that session keys for past communications are ephemeral and discarded after use, so compromising long-term keys today cannot retroactively decrypt messages from last month.  \n- Backward secrecy protects future sessions from past key compromises, which does not apply here since the concern is about past messages.\n\nThe scenario matches forward secrecy, as it specifically addresses the risk of future key exposure affecting prior encrypted sessions. This property uses temporary keys per session, making old messages secure even if long-term keys are later obtained.\n\nThus, forward secrecy is the appropriate choice to mitigate Alice and Bob's concern.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:22:07.290680+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "94425e3c-65f2-4475-be36-a7fd340eda78", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "59b30663-2c83-4be0-9ceb-ad7c72724928", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Blinding counters this by multiplying the input ciphertext \\(c\\) by a random \\(r^e \\mod n\\) (where \\(r\\) is a random blinding factor and \\(e\\) is the public exponent), so the server decrypts a randomized value \\(c' = c \\cdot r^e \\mod n\\). After decryption, the result is unblinded by multiplying by \\(r^{-1} \\mod n\\). This randomization ensures that the timing observed by the attacker depends on the unpredictable \\(c'\\) rather than the attacker's controlled \\(c\\), breaking the necessary correlation for inferring \\(p\\) or \\(q\\).
