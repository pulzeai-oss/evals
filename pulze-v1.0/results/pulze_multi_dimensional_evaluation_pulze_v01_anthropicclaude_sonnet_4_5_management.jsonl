The appropriate span of control depends on several factors:\n\n### Factors Affecting Span of Control:\n\n1. **Nature of work** - Complex tasks require narrower spans; routine tasks allow wider spans\n\n2. **Employee competence** - Skilled, experienced workers need less supervision\n\n3. **Manager's capability** - More capable managers can handle larger spans\n\n4. **Geographic dispersion** - Scattered teams require narrower spans\n\n5. **Organizational culture** - Some cultures support more autonomy than others\n\n6. **Technology and systems** - Better communication tools enable wider spans\n\n### General Guidelines:\n\n- **Traditional view**: 5-6 subordinates for complex work; up to 15-20 for routine work\n- **Modern trend**: Organizations are moving toward flatter structures with wider spans of control (often 10-15 or more)\n\nThe numbers given in the options (2, 5, or 7) are too specific and rigid. Effective span of control must be determined based on the specific organizational context rather than a fixed number.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.993, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:15:41.253001+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "2a961e3f-eac2-41f8-add9-277ed1e5f47e", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "29aaa24c-65f4-4632-8c2a-45416dab1dc2", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
