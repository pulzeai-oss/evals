Let's examine each option:\n\n*   **0) Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP):** This is a classic autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the *APC* gene, leading to a high risk of colorectal cancer and other tumors.\n*   **1) Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS):** This is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations in the *TP53* gene, predisposing individuals to a wide range of cancers at an early age (e.g., sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma).\n*   **2) Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL):** This is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the *VHL* gene, leading to an increased risk of hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and other tumors.\n*   **3) Waardenburg syndrome:** This is a genetic disorder primarily characterized by hearing loss and changes in pigmentation of the hair, skin, and eyes. It is caused by mutations in genes involved in melanocyte development (e.g., *PAX3*, *MITF*, *SOX10*). While it is a genetic syndrome, it is **not** classified as a familial cancer syndrome. It does not significantly increase the risk of developing cancer.\n\nTherefore, Waardenburg syndrome is the one that is not a familial cancer syndrome.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:42:56.863135+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "6034ec05-ea7c-45d8-87fb-27a9abd75a14", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "578fafd9-19b1-4599-9e7c-f806a91d6c07", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

While generally safe, it carries a small risk of complications, the most significant of which is miscarriage. With modern ultrasound guidance and improved techniques, the risk of miscarriage directly attributable to the procedure has decreased over time.\n\n*   Current estimates for the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis typically range from **0.5% to 1%**, which translates to approximately **1 in 100 to 1 in 200**.\n*   It's important to note that there is also a background risk of miscarriage in any pregnancy, regardless of whether a procedure is performed. The quoted risk for amniocentesis usually refers to the *additional* risk above the background risk.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **0) 1 in 10 (10%)**: This risk is far too high for modern amniocentesis.\n*   **1) 1 in 50 (2%)**: This is also higher than current estimates, though it might have been closer to historical risks in less experienced hands or without optimal guidance.\n*   **3) 1 in 1000 (0.1%)**: While some highly experienced centers might report risks approaching this low, it's generally considered lower than the average quoted risk across various practices.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:51:30.101241+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "9fb915df-921f-48a7-b3b4-d53d9e8f544a", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "18f57d62-d9b7-4d63-9e0a-66e8f696c16c", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: Which of the following conditions shows anticipation in paternal transmission? ### Choices: 0) Huntington disease 1) Marfan syndrome 2) Cystic fibrosis 3) Fragile X syndrome", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "The question asks which condition shows anticipation in paternal transmission. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1.  **Huntington disease:**\n    *   **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant.\n    *   **Cause:** Expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the *HTT* gene.\n    *   **Anticipation:** Yes, the disease tends to appear at an earlier age and/or with increased severity in successive generations.\n    *   **Parental transmission effect:** The CAG repeat is highly unstable during spermatogenesis. Therefore, the expansion of the repeat (leading to earlier onset and more severe disease, including juvenile onset) is much more common and pronounced when the disease is inherited from the **father**. This is a classic example of anticipation in paternal transmission.\n\n2.  **Marfan syndrome:**\n    *   **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant.\n    *   **Cause:** Mutations in the *FBN1* gene.\n    *   **Anticipation:** No. While there can be variable expressivity, Marfan syndrome does not exhibit anticipation due to trinucleotide repeat expansion.\n\n3.  **Cystic fibrosis:**\n    *   **Inheritance:** Autosomal recessive.\n    *   **Cause:** Mutations in the *CFTR* gene.\n    *   **Anticipation:** No. Anticipation is typically associated with dominant disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions.\n\n4.  **Fragile X syndrome:**\n    *   **Inheritance:** X-linked dominant (with variable penetrance and expressivity).\n    *   **Cause:** Expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the *FMR1* gene.\n    *   **Anticipation:** Yes.\n    *   **Parental transmission effect:** The expansion from a premutation to a full mutation (causing the syndrome) almost exclusively occurs when transmitted by the **mother**. Males with a premutation will pass on the premutation to all their daughters, but it will not expand to a full mutation. Therefore, anticipation is observed in maternal transmission, not paternal.\n\nBased on this analysis, Huntington disease is the condition that shows anticipation, particularly in paternal transmission.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:54:06.326656+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "0a2a1b61-4537-47e5-bd38-f89cd82e0f0b", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "85bc5eae-8bed-4e67-a4fd-14035f805d74", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
