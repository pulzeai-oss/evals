{"question": "### Question: What is the most likely outcome of this modification?\n﻿\nAn RNA strand that normally produces a transmembrane protein that facilitates potassium entry into muscle cells is modified to produce a different strand. The original strand is as follows:\n\n GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUAACAGA… \n\nThe modified sequence is as follows:\n\n GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUACCAGA… ### Choices: 0) Absence of the protein 1) Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein 2) No change 3) Production of a larger, likely dysfunctional protein", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "1) Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning process begins by comparing the original and modified RNA sequences to identify differences. The sequences are identical up to position 27 (GAAUAGAUGGGAAGCGCCAGAUACAGUA), with a single nucleotide substitution at position 28: adenine (A) in the original versus cytosine (C) in the modified sequence. This results in the original having ...AGU AAC AGA... and the modified having ...AGU ACC AGA....\n\nNext, the sequences are analyzed in the context of translation, assuming the coding region starts at the AUG codon (positions 9-11), which is unaffected by the mutation. The relevant codons after the common prefix are examined: in the original, the codon following AGU (Ser) is AAC, coding for asparagine (Asn); in the modified, it is ACC, coding for threonine (Thr). This indicates a missense mutation, changing a single amino acid from Asn to Thr while preserving the reading frame and overall protein length.\n\nThe impact on the protein is then evaluated: a single amino acid substitution in a transmembrane protein, such as one facilitating potassium entry, is likely to alter its structure or function without affecting size, potentially rendering it dysfunctional. This aligns with option 1, as other outcomes are ruled out: no stop codon is introduced (ruling out absence of protein), the change is not silent (ruling out no change), and no insertion or deletion occurs (ruling out a larger protein).", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.89, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:23:16.092406+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a2eaf04e-50be-4d53-ac3b-fc6b6302adf1", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "6fcd97da-373d-41c9-b9c4-681183bfd657", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 7, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 8, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 8}
