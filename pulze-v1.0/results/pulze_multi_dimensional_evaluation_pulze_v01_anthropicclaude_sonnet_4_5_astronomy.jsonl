It's positioned in the Perseus Arm of our galaxy and the Milky Way passes through it.\n\n**Cygnus**: This is prominently located right in the middle of the Milky Way band. It's one of the most notable constellations along the Milky Way in the summer sky (for northern observers), sitting in a very rich star field.\n\n**Scorpius**: This constellation is located toward the center of our galaxy and lies directly along the Milky Way. In fact, when you look at Scorpius, you're looking toward the galactic center, where the Milky Way appears brightest and widest.\n\n**Leo**: This is a zodiac constellation located well away from the plane of the Milky Way. Leo is positioned roughly 90 degrees from the galactic plane, pointing more or less perpendicular to the Milky Way band. When Leo is prominent in the sky, you're looking away from the galactic disk.\n\nThe answer is **3) Leo**.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:08:11.403351+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "048d1b19-7da5-480b-b426-b62f8300de7c", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "ce2b8528-f0b0-4544-b8ea-b9d8234efa75", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
