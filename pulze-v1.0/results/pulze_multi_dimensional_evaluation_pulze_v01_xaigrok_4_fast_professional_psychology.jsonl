{"question": "### Question: A colleague, a licensed psychologist, confides in you that he has just ended a sexual relationship with one of his clients. As he describes the client, you realize that she is someone you referred to him about 18 months ago. As an ethical psychologist, you should: ### Choices: 0) file a complaint against the colleague immediately with the Ethics Committee. 1) file a complaint against the colleague with the Ethics Committee after informing him that you intend to do so. 2) discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take. 3) contact the client and discuss the matter with her.", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "2) discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take.\n\n### Explanation\nUnder the American Psychological Association (APA) Ethics Code, particularly Standard 1.04 (Informal Resolution of Ethical Violations), when a psychologist becomes aware of a potential ethical violation by another psychologist, the first step is typically to address it informally by discussing it directly with the colleague, provided it does not violate confidentiality and appears appropriate for resolution. Sexual intimacy with a current or recent client (Standard 3.08) is a serious ethical violation that causes harm, but since your colleague has confided in you, this opens the door for an initial conversation to explore their awareness of the issue, any steps they plan (e.g., self-reporting to the Ethics Committee, terminating the professional relationship if ongoing, or seeking consultation), and potential remediation.\n\nIf the discussion reveals no appropriate plan or if informal resolution fails (per Standard 1.05), further action—such as filing a complaint with the Ethics Committee or licensing board—would be warranted to protect the client and uphold professional standards. However, immediately filing a complaint (options 0 or 1) skips this ethical process unless the situation demands urgent intervention (e.g., ongoing harm). Contacting the client (option 3) is inappropriate, as it could breach confidentiality, retraumatize the individual, and violate ethical boundaries without proper authorization or context. As the referring psychologist, you also have a duty to reflect on your own role but prioritize the ethical reporting process.
