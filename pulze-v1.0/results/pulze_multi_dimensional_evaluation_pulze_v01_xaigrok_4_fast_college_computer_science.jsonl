This results in fewer entries in the page table, which stores one entry per page, thereby making the page table smaller overall. Thus, statement I is correct.\n\nNext, examine statement II: Internal fragmentation occurs when the last allocated page of a process contains unused space. With smaller pages, the size of this unused space in the last page is minimized, leading to less total wasted memory across processes. Therefore, statement II is correct.\n\nFinally, assess statement III: In disk access, the dominant factors—seek time and rotational latency—are fixed costs that do not vary with page size. The transfer time, which does depend on page length, is typically minor. As a result, larger pages allow more data to be transferred per access without significantly increasing the overall time, providing an advantage. Hence, statement III is correct.\n\nAll three statements hold true, confirming the selection of option 3.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:20:00.673369+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "87118f1f-039f-4d03-badf-6eeec44aacb7", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "1a8f1805-576c-44f8-b7bf-4036bc958d1c", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. ### Choices: 0) I and III only 1) II and III only 2) II and IV only 3) I, II, and IV", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "3) I, II, and IV\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning begins by recalling that a height-balanced binary search tree maintains the property where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1, ensuring the tree remains approximately balanced, similar to an AVL tree. In such a tree, search operations follow the binary search tree structure, with time complexity determined by the path length from the root to the target node.\n\nNext, consider statement IV: The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. In a height-balanced BST with n nodes, the height h satisfies h = O(log n), as the balance condition prevents the tree from degenerating into a linear structure. Thus, IV is true.\n\nFor statement I: Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes. The worst-case search requires traversing the full height of the tree to reach a leaf or the deepest node, resulting in O(h) time, which is O(log n) due to the balanced height. Therefore, I is true.\n\nFor statement II: Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes. Assuming a uniform distribution of keys, the average path length in a balanced BST is proportional to the height, yielding O(log n) time on average. Hence, II is true.\n\nFinally, evaluate statement III: Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree. The best-case scenario occurs when the target key is at the root, requiring only O(1) constant time for a single comparison. This is not proportional to the height h (which is O(log n)), as proportionality would imply Θ(h) time, but O(1) remains constant regardless of h. Thus, III is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements I, II, and IV hold true, while III does not, aligning with the correct choice.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:24:44.465700+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "9fda071e-6fac-41b7-a602-00a642914ddf", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "f93cc99f-783f-48ec-8c4e-ddfdb69b1083", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}
