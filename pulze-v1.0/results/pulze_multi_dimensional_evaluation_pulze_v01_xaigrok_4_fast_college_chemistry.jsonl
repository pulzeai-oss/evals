{"question": "### Question: A single line is seen in the 31P spectrum of a solution of sodium phosphate. The 31P chemical shifts of H2PO4‾ and HPO42– are 3.42 ppm and 5.82 ppm respectively. What is the chemical shift when the pH of the solution equals the pKa of H2PO4‾? ### Choices: 0) 3.41 ppm 1) 3.98 ppm 2) 4.33 ppm 3) 4.62 ppm", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "D) 4.62 ppm\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe observation of a single line in the 31P NMR spectrum indicates rapid exchange between phosphate species, resulting in an averaged chemical shift. For phosphoric acid, the pKa of H2PO4⁻ corresponds to the second dissociation constant (pKa2 ≈ 7.2), where the equilibrium H2PO4⁻ ⇌ HPO4²⁻ + H+ is balanced. At pH equal to this pKa, the concentrations of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ are equal, assuming these are the dominant species in the solution.\n\nUnder these conditions, the observed chemical shift (δ_obs) is the mole-fraction-weighted average of the individual shifts: δ_obs = ([H2PO4⁻] × δ_H2PO4⁻ + [HPO4²⁻] × δ_HPO4²⁻) / total phosphate concentration. With [H2PO4⁻] = [HPO4²⁻], this simplifies to δ_obs = (δ_H2PO4⁻ + δ_HPO4²⁻) / 2.\n\nSubstituting the given values: δ_obs = (3.42 ppm + 5.82 ppm) / 2 = 9.24 ppm / 2 = 4.62 ppm. This calculation aligns with the conditions of rapid exchange and equal speciation at the specified pH.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:16:09.802965+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "2f95ff4c-024a-4a2e-a385-fc22b84b4022", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "b49248b8-4443-4e48-9cb7-0ca9e9e96ccf", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

The chemical shift difference Δδ in ppm is calculated using the formula Δδ = Δν / ν₀, where Δν is the frequency difference in Hz and ν₀ is the spectrometer frequency in MHz.\n\nGiven that the Larmor frequency of benzene exceeds that of trifluoroacetic acid by 1.656 kHz (equivalent to 1656 Hz), and knowing that higher resonance frequency corresponds to a lower chemical shift, the difference is Δδ = δ_TFA - δ_benzene.\n\nSubstitute the values: Δδ = 1656 Hz / 400 MHz = 4.14 ppm.\n\nThus, δ_TFA = δ_benzene + Δδ = 7.16 ppm + 4.14 ppm = 11.30 ppm.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:18:01.851719+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "b55a4fb1-0787-4289-8d38-4559e9e14768", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "25c2b906-6a3a-4766-900d-82e0d7c07ad2", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

{"question": "### Question: Nitronyl nitroxides are stable radicals in which the unpaired electron is coupled to two equivalent nitrogen nuclei.

In this state, the two radical units are equivalent, each with two nitrogen nuclei, for a total of four nuclei.\n\nThe EPR transitions observed are primarily ΔM_S = 1 (from M_S = 0 to M_S = 1, and M_S = -1 to M_S = 0). In the high-field approximation, the hyperfine shift for these transitions is (a/2) × (m_{JA} + m_{JB}), where m_{JA} and m_{JB} are the total z-projections for the nuclear spins of units A and B, respectively (each ranging from -2 to 2).\n\nThe possible values of M = m_{JA} + m_{JB} thus range from -4 to 4 in integer steps, producing 9 distinct hyperfine levels. These correspond to 9 equally spaced lines in the spectrum, with separations of a/2 between adjacent lines.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the EPR spectrum consists of 9 lines, accounting for the symmetry and strong coupling in the triplet state.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.74, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:33:11.840786+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "7bf4525f-85ac-4edf-ae5f-7ba33e15be5e", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "094b15db-4a42-4f09-83bc-d6bcf0df9ba1", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 0, "clarity": 9, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 5}
