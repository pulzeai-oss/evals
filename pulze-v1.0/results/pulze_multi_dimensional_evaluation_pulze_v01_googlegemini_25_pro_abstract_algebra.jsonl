Understand the Group and its Order**\n\n*   The group is G = Z_11 x Z_15, which is the direct product of the cyclic group of integers modulo 11 and the cyclic group of integers modulo 15.\n*   The order of a direct product of finite groups is the product of their orders.\n*   The order of Z_11 is 11.\n*   The order of Z_15 is 15.\n*   Therefore, the order of the group G is |G| = |Z_11| * |Z_15| = 11 * 15 = 165.\n\n**2. Understand the Subgroup and its Order**\n\n*   The subgroup is H = <(1, 1)>, which is the cyclic subgroup generated by the element (1, 1).\n*   The order of this subgroup is equal to the order of the generating element (1, 1).\n*   The order of an element (a, b) in a direct product G₁ x G₂ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the order of 'a' in G₁ and the order of 'b' in G₂.\n    *   Order of (a, b) = lcm(order(a), order(b))\n*   In our case, a = 1 in Z_11 and b = 1 in Z_15.\n    *   The order of 1 in Z_11 is 11 (since 1 generates the entire group Z_11).\n    *   The order of 1 in Z_15 is 15 (since 1 generates the entire group Z_15).\n*   So, the order of the element (1, 1) is lcm(11, 15).\n*   To calculate lcm(11, 15), we can use the formula: lcm(x, y) = (x * y) / gcd(x, y).\n    *   The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 11 and 15 is 1, as 11 is a prime number and not a factor of 15.\n    *   lcm(11, 15) = (11 * 15) / 1 = 165.\n*   Therefore, the order of the subgroup H is |H| = 165.\n\n**3. Calculate the Order of the Factor Group**\n\n*   The order of a factor group G/H is given by Lagrange's Theorem:\n    *   |G/H| = |G| / |H|\n*   Plugging in the values we found:\n    *   |G/H| = 165 / 165 = 1.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe subgroup <(1, 1)> has the same order as the entire group (Z_11 x Z_15), which means the subgroup is the group itself. The factor group of a group by itself, G/G, always has an order of 1 (it contains only the identity element).\n\nThe order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<(1, 1)>) is **1**.\n\nThis corresponds to choice **0**.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.97, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:15:21.056596+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "0a0e9ee2-5ea6-4cfa-8f31-e40b9719efb4", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "1f642b9b-3a86-430d-a572-93c0af8088ad", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}

Let I be a maximal ideal in a commutative ring R (with unity).\n    2.  The quotient ring R/I is already known to be a commutative ring with unity (the unity element is 1+I).\n    3.  To be a field, we only need to show that every non-zero element in R/I has a multiplicative inverse.\n    4.  A non-zero element in R/I is a coset a+I where a ∉ I.\n    5.  Let a+I be a non-zero element. Consider the ideal J = I + (a).\n    6.  As in the proof for Statement 1, since a ∉ I and I is maximal, we must have J = R.\n    7.  This means 1 ∈ J, so 1 = i + ra for some i ∈ I and r ∈ R.\n    8.  Now, consider this equation in the quotient ring R/I:\n        1 + I = (i + ra) + I = (i + I) + (ra + I)\n    9.
