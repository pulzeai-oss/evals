{"question": "### Question: The risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 infection during breast feeding is increased due to: ### Choices: 0) Mixed feeding 1) Very early introduction of solids 2) Both a and b 3) None of them", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the context of the question\nThe question is about the risk factors associated with the perinatal transmission of HIV-1 infection during breastfeeding.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the specific risk factors mentioned\nThe options provided are \"Mixed feeding\" and \"Very early introduction of solids.\" We need to understand how these factors relate to the transmission of HIV-1 during breastfeeding.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the given options in relation to HIV-1 transmission during breastfeeding\n- Mixed feeding refers to the practice of giving a baby both breast milk and other foods or formula. Research has suggested that mixed feeding may increase the risk of HIV transmission compared to exclusive breastfeeding, possibly due to inflammation or irritation in the infant's gastrointestinal tract caused by the introduction of other foods or substances.\n- Very early introduction of solids is related to mixed feeding, as it involves giving the baby foods other than breast milk at a very young age.\n\n## Step 4: Relate the given options to known facts about HIV transmission\nIt is known that exclusive breastfeeding is generally recommended for HIV-positive mothers when possible, as it reduces the risk of HIV transmission to the infant compared to mixed feeding. The introduction of other foods or liquids can cause mucosal damage or inflammation, potentially increasing the risk of HIV transmission.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the correct answer based on the analysis\nGiven that mixed feeding is associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 transmission during breastfeeding, and very early introduction of solids is a form of mixed feeding, both practices are related to an increased risk. Thus, the option that includes both \"Mixed feeding\" is the most relevant.\n\n## Step 6: Choose the best answer\nSince \"Mixed feeding\" is a known risk factor and \"Very early introduction of solids\" contributes to mixed feeding, the best answer should reflect this understanding.\n\nThe best answer is 2.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:21:07.942718+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "8b6f0770-93b3-409d-bff7-20f1be98b8c6", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "b0c92385-90ed-4691-822d-b1abeccea1d0", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Pasteur - This statement is not true as the vaccine has undergone significant changes since Pasteur's time.\n1) The original air-dried spinal cord of infected rabbits was a killed vaccine - Pasteur's original vaccine was not a killed vaccine in the modern sense; it was attenuated.\n2) The vaccine still needs 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity - This is not accurate. Modern rabies vaccines are given intramuscularly, not into the peritoneal cavity, and the number of doses has been reduced.\n3) The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo - Modern rabies vaccines are indeed grown in cell cultures, and human diploid cell cultures are one of the substrates used.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the options based on the facts about rabies vaccine\n- Option 0 is incorrect because the vaccine has evolved.\n- Option 1 is misleading as the original vaccine was attenuated, not killed.\n- Option 2 is incorrect as it misrepresents the administration route and number of doses.\n- Option 3 is correct as modern rabies vaccines are grown in human diploid cell cultures, which are derived from human embryonic tissues.\n\n## Step 5: Choose the best answer\nGiven the information, the best answer is related to the characteristics of modern rabies vaccines.\n\nThe best answer is 3.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.707, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:23:51.077508+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "89bcb447-edf1-424e-a907-0326304e8ccf", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "025cc98d-c96d-44ac-8d77-55270fa21b9e", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 2, "clarity": 8, "completeness": 7, "conciseness": 7, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 5}
