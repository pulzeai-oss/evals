While parents are involved in education, there's also a strong emphasis on personal responsibility, especially for older teenagers. The student themselves would likely share significant blame.\n\n**Canadian**: Similar to the US, Canada has an individualistic culture with similar attitudes toward personal responsibility and education.\n\n**Japanese**: Japan has a collectivist culture with very strong emphasis on family responsibility and honor. Japanese culture places enormous pressure on families regarding their children's academic success. Parents are expected to be heavily involved in their children's education, and a child's failure reflects on the entire family. There's a cultural concept of bringing shame to the family through poor performance.

The most commonly prescribed antidepressants are SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) like Prozac, Zoloft, and Lexapro, which work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Other antidepressants like SNRIs also affect serotonin (along with norepinephrine). The serotonin hypothesis of depression has been central to understanding and treating MDD.\n\n1) **Dopamine** - While dopamine plays a role in mood and motivation, and some antidepressants (like bupropion/Wellbutrin) do affect dopamine, it's not the primary neurotransmitter targeted by most antidepressants for MDD.\n\n2) **Acetylcholine** - This neurotransmitter is primarily involved in muscle movement, memory, and learning. It's not a primary target for antidepressant medications. Anticholinergic effects are often side effects of some medications, but acetylcholine isn't the main target for treating depression.\n\n3) **Thorazine** - This is actually not a neurotransmitter at all. Thorazine (chlorpromazine) is an antipsychotic medication, not a neurotransmitter. This appears to be a distractor option.\n\nThe correct answer is clearly **serotonin (option 0)**, as it is the primary neurotransmitter targeted by the most commonly prescribed medications for major depressive disorder.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>0) serotonin</answer>\n\nThe answer is **0) serotonin**.\n\nMedications prescribed for major depressive disorder most commonly target serotonin.
