{"question": "### Question: In what ways does the idea of 'victim' impact on the way in which gender security is regarded? ### Choices: 0) Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. In 1990 an estimated 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. Reports that women are the primary casualties of war has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well bring for the protection of women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery). 1) The role of men as intrinsically heroic has been marginalized as the traumas of war, desertion, and conscription become more apparent. When imagining victims, there is no longer a gender divide. Instead, there is a growing perception that those who fight are courageous and heroic, whilst those who do not take on female characteristics. 2) Increasing awareness regarding the barbaric nature of warfare and the problems of trauma in war has led to a reversal in the belief that the idea of war is a natural place for males. In contemporary societies across the globe, men are regarded as the victims of gender stereotypes that coerce them into violent behaviour as 'protectors' or aggressors on behalf of the state. 3) All of these options.", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "**Answer: 3) All of these options.**", "answering_model": "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b", "overall_score": 0.6428571428571429, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:57:33.339200+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "13ff13a7-8c1f-41ab-a9ec-ab350330afbf", "evaluation_run_id": "55c9d212-ef47-4102-8350-c68f2d30c738", "dataset_item_id": "c70c3aee-8b66-449f-8018-02afbb6adfba", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 0, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 5}
{"question": "### Question: What are Fission Nuclear Weapons? ### Choices: 0) Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion. 1) Implosion fissure devices are constructed with relative ease because unlike the gun-type fissure device it uses high-explosive shaped lenses to compress the fissile material to critical tolerance. Detonation is highly volatile with a high potential of \"going critical\". 2) Fissile weapons are produced by the rapid rearrangement of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in a chamber, striking each other at high velocities the friction sparking a chemical explosion. 3) Gun-type devices are of rugged design using two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities with a high probability of producing a reaction. Implosion devices are more complex, requiring the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing.", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "**Answer: 3** – Gun‑type fission weapons fire two sub‑critical masses together in a barrel, while implosion weapons use precisely timed shaped‑charge explosives to compress a sub‑critical fissile core to a supercritical state.

{"question": "### Question: To what extent and to what effect has the environment been securitized? ### Choices: 0) The securitization of environmental security concerns has raised the profile of environmental security issues among both foreign and domestic security policymakers and agencies. It is now uniformly recognized that environmental change can be considered as an issue of high security politics. 1) Environmental security has led to a 'trading off' of military security for environmental security with the allocation of resources committed to solving environmental problems. A particular emphasis has been placed on environmental change as the cause of violent conflict and addressing environmental threats from other factors than domestic causes. 2) The environment has been 'securitized' in the sense that environmental security has been used to make them matters of 'high politics'. This has to some degree raised the profile of critical issues among policymakers and agencies so that the environment can be considered an issue of security. But whilst the issue has been broadened there has been little change in policy and action in terms of the referent object of environmental security. 3) The national security perspective on environmental issues has undermined the utility of the concept of environmental security. The militarization of environmental problems has decreased the ability of policymakers to 'capture' the critical nature of environmental problems and the environmental dimensions to social vulnerability. The reconciliation of environmental security with national security, and global levels of international change cannot be made without trading in the security interests of the state.", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "**Answer: 2** – The environment has been “securitized” in the sense that environmental security has been framed as a matter of high politics.

{"question": "### Question: What would be the policy implications of a hierarchical vision of TNC? ### Choices: 0) Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential. 1) The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced. 2) Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation. 3) Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership.
