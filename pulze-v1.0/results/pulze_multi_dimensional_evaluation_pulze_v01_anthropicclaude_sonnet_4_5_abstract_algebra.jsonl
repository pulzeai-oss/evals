Here are several examples:\n\n1. **Trivial homomorphism**: For any groups G and H, we can define φ(g) = e_H for all g ∈ G, where e_H is the identity of H. This is always a homomorphism.\n\n2. **Non-trivial example**: Consider G = ℤ₆ (cyclic group of order 6) and H = ℤ₁₂ (cyclic group of order 12). We can define φ: ℤ₆ → ℤ₁₂ by φ(x) = 2x (mod 12). This is a homomorphism because:\n   - φ(x + y) = 2(x + y) = 2x + 2y = φ(x) + φ(y)\n   - The image would be {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, which has 6 elements and is a subgroup of ℤ₁₂.\n\n3.
