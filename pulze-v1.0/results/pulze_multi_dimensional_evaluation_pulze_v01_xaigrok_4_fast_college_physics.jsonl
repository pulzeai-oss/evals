This directly links the wavelength and momentum via h as the proportionality constant.\n\nNext, the other choices are evaluated for relevance: Boltzmann’s constant applies to statistical mechanics and thermal energy, not wave-particle duality; the Rydberg constant pertains to atomic spectral lines and energy levels; and the speed of light is fundamental in electromagnetic theory and relativity but does not connect momentum to wavelength for massive particles.\n\nThus, only Planck’s constant fits the hypothesis, as it is the established factor in the de Broglie relation for free massive particles.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:24:55.336200+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "cd741ff0-1bdd-4dac-9046-d0c93f965a36", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "1531a2d4-ce24-42c8-8f2c-635089c49a16", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

How much energy is required to ionize helium (i.e., to remove one electron)? ### Choices: 0) 24.6 eV 1) 39.5 eV 2) 51.8 eV 3) 54.4 eV", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "A) 24.6 eV\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning begins by identifying that the total energy of 79.0 eV represents the sum of the energy required to remove the first electron from neutral helium (He → He⁺ + e⁻), denoted as E1, and the energy to remove the second electron from the resulting ion (He⁺ → He²⁺ + e⁻), denoted as E2. Thus, E1 + E2 = 79.0 eV.\n\nNext, E2 is determined using the formula for the ionization energy of hydrogen-like atoms: 13.6 eV × Z² / n², where Z is the atomic number and n is the principal quantum number. For He⁺, Z = 2 and n = 1 (ground state), so E2 = 13.6 eV × (2)² / (1)² = 13.6 eV × 4 = 54.4 eV.\n\nThen, E1 is calculated by subtracting E2 from the total energy: E1 = 79.0 eV - 54.4 eV = 24.6 eV.\n\nThis value aligns with the known first ionization energy of helium, confirming the sequential addition of energies for the two-step process.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:26:55.280605+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "72006536-2c58-420d-878c-55166d0dbdd3", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "eefa5290-fc91-4891-945a-716291b051a7", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released? ### Choices: 0) 0 1) 40 m/s down 2) 80 m/s down 3) 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "B) 40 m/s down\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning follows these steps based on the principles of projectile motion and relative velocity:\n\n1. The payload is released with the same initial velocity as the plane: 100 m/s north (horizontal) and 0 m/s vertical, due to the plane's constant speed parallel to the ground.\n\n2. With air resistance neglected, the horizontal velocity of the payload remains constant at 100 m/s north, as no horizontal forces act on it.\n\n3. Vertically, the payload undergoes free fall under gravity (g ≈ 9.8 m/s², often approximated as 10 m/s² in such problems). After 4.0 s, the vertical velocity is v_y = g × t = 9.8 m/s² × 4.0 s ≈ 39.2 m/s downward, or exactly 40 m/s downward using g = 10 m/s².\n\n4. The plane maintains a constant velocity of 100 m/s north and 0 m/s vertical.\n\n5. The velocity of the payload relative to the plane is found by subtracting the plane's velocity from the payload's velocity: (100 m/s north + 40 m/s down) - (100 m/s north + 0 m/s down) = 0 m/s north + 40 m/s down.\n\nThus, the relative velocity is 40 m/s downward.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:29:16.647049+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "210699f6-2b0f-473d-9429-bdaa1f96b80e", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "6e14c890-727a-403c-8ab3-b626c5019cc5", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
