{"question": "### Question: Every day Melanie spends her lunch money consuming apples, at $1 each, and oranges, at $2 each. At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility? ### Choices: 0) She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges. 1) She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. 2) She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. 3) She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "<think>\nTo maximize utility, a consumer should allocate their budget so that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across all goods.\n\nLet me calculate the marginal utility per dollar for each good:\n\n**Apples:**\n- Price = $1\n- Marginal Utility = 12\n- MU per dollar = 12/1 = 12\n\n**Oranges:**\n- Price = $2\n- Marginal Utility = 18\n- MU per dollar = 18/2 = 9\n\nCurrently, Melanie is getting 12 utils per dollar from apples but only 9 utils per dollar from oranges.\n\nSince apples give her more utility per dollar spent (12 > 9), she should:\n- **Increase consumption of apples** (the good with higher MU per dollar)\n- **Decrease consumption of oranges** (the good with lower MU per dollar)\n\nAs she consumes more apples, the marginal utility of apples will decrease (law of diminishing marginal utility). As she consumes fewer oranges, the marginal utility of oranges will increase.\n\nShe should continue adjusting until:\nMU_apples / P_apples = MU_oranges / P_oranges\n\nThis means she should continue until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Option 0: Incorrect - she's not at the optimal combination\n- Option 1: **Correct** - increase apples, decrease oranges until MU per dollar is equal\n- Option 2: Incorrect - this would move her further from optimum\n- Option 3: Incorrect - the condition should be MU per dollar equal, not just MU equal\n</think>\n\nTo maximize utility, Melanie needs to equalize the **marginal utility per dollar** across both goods.\n\nLet me calculate her current situation:\n\n**Apples:**\n- MU per dollar = 12 รท $1 = **12 utils per dollar**\n\n**Oranges:**\n- MU per dollar = 18 รท $2 = **9 utils per dollar**\n\nSince apples provide more utility per dollar spent (12 > 9), Melanie is not maximizing her utility.

When price decreases, quantity demanded increases, and vice versa. I need to identify which concept explains this inverse relationship.\n\nLet me examine each option:\n\n**Option 0: Substitution effects and income effects**\n- **Substitution effect**: When the price of a good falls, it becomes relatively cheaper compared to other goods, so consumers substitute toward this good and away from others.\n- **Income effect**: When the price of a good falls, consumers' real purchasing power (real income) increases, allowing them to buy more of the good (assuming it's a normal good).\n- These two effects work together to explain why quantity demanded increases as price falls, creating the downward slope.\n\n**Option 1: The law of increasing marginal costs**\n- This relates to the supply side of the market, not demand. It explains why the supply curve slopes upward, not why the demand curve slopes downward.\n\n**Option 2: The principle of comparative advantage**\n- This explains patterns of trade and specialization between countries or individuals. It doesn't directly explain consumer behavior regarding price and quantity demanded.\n\n**Option 3: The law of diminishing marginal returns to production**\n- This is a production concept that relates to how output changes as more of a variable input is added. This is a supply-side concept, not a demand-side concept.\n\nThe correct answer is **Option 0: Substitution effects and income effects**. These are the two fundamental effects that explain why consumers demand more of a good when its price falls, creating the downward-sloping demand curve.\n\n</think>\n\nThe answer is **0) Substitution effects and income effects**.\n\nThe downward-sloping demand curve is explained by two key effects:\n\n1. **Substitution Effect**: When a good's price decreases, it becomes relatively cheaper compared to other goods. Consumers respond by substituting toward the now-cheaper good and away from alternatives.\n\n2. **Income Effect**: When a good's price falls, consumers' real purchasing power (real income) increases. This allows them to purchase more of the good, assuming it's a normal good.\n\nTogether, these effects explain why quantity demanded increases as price falls, creating the characteristic downward slope of the demand curve.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- Options 1 and 3 relate to production/supply-side concepts\n- Option 2 deals with trade theory, not consumer demand behavior", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:18:52.876376+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "5744c293-1781-450b-8b6c-0c7aabe9b777", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "f9876bf3-fba9-464e-8c64-2b628a91b13e", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
