Factors like effective contraception, changing social norms, and the rise of cohabitation have made premarital sex far more common and widely accepted.\n*   **Extramarital Sex:** In contrast, attitudes toward infidelity (sex outside of one's marriage) have remained overwhelmingly negative. In fact, some survey data suggests that disapproval has become even more pronounced.

{"question": "### Question: The onset (the very beginning) of labor is first triggered by ### Choices: 0) hormones secreted by the Mother's ovaries 1) hormones secreted by the Mother's hypothalamus 2) hormones secreted by the fetus' adrenal gland 3) the placenta and uterus secretion of prostaglandins", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **2) hormones secreted by the fetus' adrenal gland**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\nThe current scientific understanding is that the fetus, not the mother, initiates the onset of labor. This process is often referred to as the \"fetal-maternal crosstalk.\"\n\n1.  **The Fetal Trigger:** As the fetus reaches full term, its adrenal glands mature and release a surge of hormones, primarily **cortisol**.\n2.  **Placental Reaction:** This fetal cortisol travels to the placenta and triggers a crucial hormonal shift. It causes the placenta to decrease its production of progesterone (the hormone that keeps the uterus calm and prevents contractions) and increase its production of estrogen.\n3.  **Uterine Preparation:** The resulting high estrogen-to-progesterone ratio makes the uterus more sensitive to hormones that cause contractions (like oxytocin) and stimulates the production of **prostaglandins**.\n4.  **Labor Begins:** Prostaglandins help to soften and ripen the cervix and, along with oxytocin, initiate uterine contractions, marking the beginning of labor.\n\n**Why the other options are less accurate:**\n\n*   **0) & 1) Maternal Hormones:** While maternal hormones like oxytocin (from the hypothalamus/pituitary) are essential for *sustaining and strengthening* labor contractions, they are not the initial trigger. The uterus first needs to be made receptive to them by the hormonal cascade started by the fetus.\n*   **3) Prostaglandins:** The secretion of prostaglandins is a critical step that directly leads to contractions and cervical changes, but it is a *result* of the initial trigger from the fetal adrenal gland, not the trigger itself.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:41:32.401782+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "fb5827a5-51e1-465f-81f1-be81233a9b3e", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "455e23f4-04d2-43b3-8a84-b5c24fe149b6", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
