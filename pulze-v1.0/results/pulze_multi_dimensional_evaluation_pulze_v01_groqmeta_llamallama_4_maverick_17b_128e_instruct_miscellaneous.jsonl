The substance used had to be safe for the actress, Janet Leigh, and also had to be visible on black and white film.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the given choices\nThe options given are tomato juice, red wine, chocolate syrup, and ketchup. All of these could potentially be used to represent blood due to their red color.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the correct substance used in 'Psycho'\nHistorically, the substance used in the shower scene of 'Psycho' was chocolate syrup. This might seem unusual, but chocolate syrup was chosen because it was more visible on black and white film than red wine or other alternatives, and it didn't coagulate or separate like some other options might.\n\nThe best answer is 2.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.92, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:05:24.089639+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "946df279-ca61-4c45-a77d-095b58682a17", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "f9a6c450-62ab-4f04-92c0-0188f4f82149", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 9, "completeness": 9, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 9}
{"question": "### Question: Which of the following heavenly bodies have never had a spacecraft landed on it? ### Choices: 0) Venus 1) Mars 2) The Moon 3) Jupiter", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Review the history of space exploration for each listed heavenly body.\nTo determine which of the heavenly bodies listed have never had a spacecraft landed on them, we need to review the history of space exploration for Venus, Mars, the Moon, and Jupiter.\n\n## Step\n\n### Step 2: Examine the history of spacecraft landings on Venus.\nThe Soviet Union's Venera program successfully landed several spacecraft on Venus, starting with Venera 7 in 1970. Therefore, Venus has had spacecraft landed on it.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the history of spacecraft landings on Mars.\nNASA's Viking missions in the 1970s successfully landed on Mars, as have several other missions since then, including NASA's Curiosity Rover. Thus, Mars has had spacecraft landed on it.\n\n## Step 4: Examine the history of spacecraft landings on the Moon.\nThe first successful lunar landing was achieved by NASA's Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Since then, several other manned and unmanned missions have landed on the Moon. So, the Moon has had spacecraft landed on it.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the history of spacecraft landings on Jupiter.\nJupiter is a gas giant, meaning it has no solid surface. While NASA's Galileo spacecraft orbited Jupiter and sent a probe into its atmosphere, it did not land on Jupiter in the traditional sense used for rocky bodies like Mars or the Moon. The probe entered Jupiter's atmosphere and transmitted data until it was destroyed by the extreme conditions.\n\n## Step 6: Determine which heavenly body has never had a spacecraft landed on it based on the definition of \"landed.\"\nGiven that \"landed\" typically implies touching down on a solid surface, Jupiter, being a gas giant without a solid surface, has not had a spacecraft \"land\" on it in the same way as the other bodies listed.\n\n## Step 7: Choose the correct answer based on the analysis.\nSince Venus, Mars, and the Moon have all had spacecraft land on them, and Jupiter does not have a solid surface for a spacecraft to land on, Jupiter is the correct answer.\n\nThe best answer is 3.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:01:08.722175+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "368ee630-8375-4564-9954-75ca4f36ae80", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "671b5ebe-ce30-4734-a4bc-d03c56876a5f", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

{"question": "### Question: On which part of a car would you find the 'caliper'? ### Choices: 0) battery 1) engine 2) radiator 3) brakes", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "To determine where the 'caliper' is located on a car, let's consider what a caliper is in the context of automotive parts. A caliper is a component that houses the brake pads and pistons that press against the brake rotor to stop the vehicle. Given this function, it's directly related to the braking system of the car.\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n\n0) Battery - The battery is related to the electrical system of the car, providing power to start the engine and run accessories. It's not directly related to the braking function.\n\n1) Engine - The engine is the heart of the car, generating power. While it's crucial for the car's movement, the caliper is not a part of the engine.\n\n2) Radiator - The radiator is part of the cooling system, helping to regulate the engine's temperature. It's not associated with the braking system.\n\n3) Brakes - As mentioned, the caliper is directly related to the braking system. It's the component that clamps the brake pads against the rotor to slow or stop the car.\n\nTherefore, the caliper is associated with the brakes.\n\nThe best answer is 3) brakes.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:04:10.092715+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "ec6c7635-bcd9-4a44-ab6d-96f9f7ce8f70", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "6858704b-f7bc-47f6-b563-6c9705ce896c", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
