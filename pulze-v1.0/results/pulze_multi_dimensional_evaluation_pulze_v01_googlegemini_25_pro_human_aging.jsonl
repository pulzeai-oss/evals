This is due to two main factors:\n    1.  **An Aging Population:** As people live longer due to advances in treating other conditions like heart disease and cancer, they are more likely to reach the advanced ages where Alzheimer's is most common.\n    2.  **Better Diagnosis and Reporting:** There is greater awareness of the disease, and doctors are more likely to list it as an official cause of death on death certificates than they were in the past.\n\n*   **Cancer & Cardiovascular Diseases:** While still leading causes of death, the age-adjusted death rates for both cancer and cardiovascular diseases have been steadily **decreasing** over the last few decades due to better prevention, screening, and treatments.\n\n*   **Homicide:** Homicide rates fluctuate year to year and have not shown the same consistent, dramatic increase as Alzheimer's over the last 20 years.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:24:00.884482+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "41676d05-adae-49fe-8e35-6001b0a6c146", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "64888354-06c0-4623-872d-774e35622430", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
