Kamm analyzes Michael Sandel's arguments in \"The Case Against Perfection.\" Sandel's primary objection to genetic enhancement is that it represents a \"promethean\" drive for mastery and control that corrupts our appreciation for the \"giftedness\" of life. He argues that we should have an attitude of humility and acceptance toward the natural talents and limitations we are born with.\n\nKamm points out that for this argument to work, Sandel must be assuming that there is something morally significant or valuable about nature as it is given to us. This attitude of appreciating \"the given\" or \"the gifted\" is akin to treating nature as something sacred that should be honored and accepted, rather than as raw material to be reshaped according to our desires. Therefore, Kamm claims that Sandel's distinction between acceptable treatment (which restores a natural norm) and unacceptable enhancement (which overreaches and tries to master nature) rests on the underlying assumption that nature itself has a special moral status that commands our respect.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:51:45.079939+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "33af895f-c077-4eb0-a890-b10f981de903", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "a44f2d3a-b3ff-4d82-a9f7-7cf36b5f5d31", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

This trains them to think in ways that are counterproductive to mental health.\n*   **2) Ill-prepare them for the workforce:** The authors contend that by shielding students from differing viewpoints and emotional discomfort, universities fail to build the resilience and \"antifragility\" necessary for professional life. The real world is not a \"safe space,\" and graduates will need to be able to handle disagreement, criticism, and conflict constructively.\n*   **3) Harm their ability to learn:** A core purpose of higher education is to challenge existing beliefs and engage with difficult, sometimes offensive, ideas. If students are encouraged to avoid or shut down ideas that cause discomfort, their ability to think critically, weigh evidence, and pursue truth is severely hampered.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.921, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:55:42.336331+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "ebbc46e0-a26f-44c8-8728-4808d00edb43", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "56f4e311-7e28-4d93-a4e2-2a20bf4b874c", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 7, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 9}
