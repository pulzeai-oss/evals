Repeated gravitational kicks at these resonances clear the orbits. |\n| 2) Gaps in Saturn’s rings | The Cassini Division and many narrower gaps. | Many gaps are maintained by **orbital resonances** with Saturn’s moons (e.g., the 2:1 resonance with Mimas creates the Cassini Division). |\n\n**Why choice 3 is not a resonance effect**\n\nThe breakup of small inner moons of Jupiter (e.g., Metis, Adrastea) that supplies material for Jupiter’s faint rings is driven primarily by **tidal forces** and the planet’s Roche‑limit environment. While the moons may experience some resonant perturbations, the actual disintegration that creates ring particles is a consequence of the moons being inside the Roche limit and being pulled apart by Jupiter’s gravity, not a result of a specific orbital resonance.\n\nHence, the only option that is **not** caused by orbital resonance is **choice 3**.", "answering_model": "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:15:32.331612+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "60b99bf3-e902-4c6d-a8a3-32cd9d22d4a2", "evaluation_run_id": "55c9d212-ef47-4102-8350-c68f2d30c738", "dataset_item_id": "74a17606-1f8a-481d-aed0-f88dc4017944", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
