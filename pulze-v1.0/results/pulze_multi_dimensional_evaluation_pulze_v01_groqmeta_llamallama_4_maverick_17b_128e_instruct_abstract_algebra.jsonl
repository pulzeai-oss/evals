This implies $n \\mod 11 = 0$ and $n \\mod 15 = 0$. Thus, $n$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 15. Since 11 is prime and does not divide 15, and 15 is not a multiple of 11, the LCM of 11 and 15 is $11 \\times 15 = 165$. Therefore, the order of $<1, 1>$ is 165.\n\n## Step ## Step 3: Calculate the Order of the Factor Group\nThe order of the factor group $(Z_{11} \\times Z_{15})/(<1, 1>)$ is given by the formula $\\frac{|Z_{11} \\times Z_{15}|}{|<1, 1>|}$. We have already determined that $|Z_{11} \\times Z_{15}| = 165$ and $|<1, 1>| = 165$.\n\n## Step ## Step 4: Apply the Formula\nSubstitute the values into the formula: $\\frac{165}{165} = 1$.\n\nThe best answer is 0.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.921, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:15:21.057191+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "77f1e17f-8a69-442f-983e-36ef48177de0", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "1f642b9b-3a86-430d-a572-93c0af8088ad", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 9, "clarity": 9, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 9}

Statement 1 claims that the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements. Statement 2 asserts that there is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate Statement 1\nTo assess Statement 1, we need to consider the properties of group homomorphisms. A homomorphism is a function between groups that preserves the group operation. The image of a group under a homomorphism is a subgroup of the target group. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. For a group of 6 elements, the possible orders of subgroups (and thus images under homomorphisms) are 1, 2, 3, and 6, since these are the divisors of 6. Therefore, the image cannot have 12 elements because 12 is not a divisor of 6. Hence, Statement 1 is false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate Statement 2\nFor Statement 2, we need to determine if there exists a homomorphism from a group of 6 elements to a group of 12 elements. Considering the groups involved, a simple example is the cyclic group $C_6$ (of order 6) and the cyclic group $C_{12}$ (of order 12). There is a homomorphism from $C_6$ to $C_{12}$ because we can map the generator of $C_6$ to an element in $C_{12}$ whose order divides 6. For instance, mapping the generator of $C_6$ to the element of order 6 in $C_{12}$ (which is $2 \\mod 12$) is a valid homomorphism. Thus, Statement 2 is true.\n\n## Step 4: Choose the correct answer based on the evaluations\nGiven that Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, we need to find the choice that corresponds to this evaluation.\n\n## Step 5: Match the evaluation to the given choices\nThe choices are: 0) True, True; 1) False, False; 2) True, False; 3) False, True.

Statement 2 | If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is field. ### Choices: 0) True, True 1) False, False 2) True, False 3) False, True", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the statements given\nFirst, let's understand the two statements. Statement 1 claims that every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. Statement 2 claims that if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nTo analyze Statement 1, we need to recall the definitions of maximal and prime ideals. A maximal ideal is an ideal that is not contained in any other proper ideal. A prime ideal is an ideal such that if the product of two elements is in the ideal, then at least one of the elements must be in the ideal. It is known that every maximal ideal in a commutative ring with unity is a prime ideal because if $ab \\in I$ and $a \\notin I$, then $I + (a) = R$, implying there's $r \\in R$ and $i \\in I$ such that $ra + i = 1$. Multiplying by $b$, we get $rab + ib = b$, so $b = (rb + i)b \\in I$ since $rab \\in I$ and $ib \\in I$. Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Statement 2\nFor Statement 2, we examine if R/I is a field when I is maximal. By definition, R/I is a field if every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. For $a + I \\in R/I$, if $a \\notin I$, then $I + (a) = R$ because $I$ is maximal. This implies there exist $r \\in R$ and $i \\in I$ such that $ra + i = 1$. Thus, $(r + I)(a + I) = ra + I = 1 + I$ since $i \\in I$, showing that $a + I$ has an inverse. Hence, R/I is a field, making Statement 2 true.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the truth values of both statements\nFrom Step 2 and Step 3, we have established that both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true.\n\nThe best answer is 0.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.89, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:16:41.794741+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "f43f66cc-8100-4ca5-b3fe-2304b62982bc", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "babf7a74-ba8b-44ce-984e-6dad19cd36db", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 5, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 8}

Statement 2 | The function g must necessarily be surjective. ### Choices: 0) True, True 1) False, False 2) True, False 3) False, True", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the given problem and the conditions provided.\nWe are given two sets, A and B, and two functions, f: A -> B and g: B -> A, with the condition that for all $a \\in A$, $g(f(a)) = a$. We need to analyze two statements: Statement 1, which claims that the function g must necessarily be injective, and Statement 2, which claims that the function g must necessarily be surjective.\n\n## Step ## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1 - The function g must necessarily be injective.\nTo check if g is injective, we need to see if $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$ implies $b_1 = b_2$ for all $b_1, b_2 \\in B$. Let's consider $b_1, b_2 \\in B$ such that $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$. We need to determine if this implies $b_1 = b_2$. Since $g(f(a)) = a$ for all $a \\in A$, it means that for any $a$, $f(a)$ is a specific element in B that maps back to $a$ under g. However, to directly check the injectivity of g, we should examine if there are elements in B that are not in the image of f, because g's behavior on those elements is not directly constrained by $g(f(a)) = a$.\n\n## Step ## Step 3: Examine the injectivity of g further.\nAssume $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$. To prove g is injective, we need to show $b_1 = b_2$. If $b_1$ and $b_2$ are in the image of f, then there exist $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ such that $f(a_1) = b_1$ and $f(a_2) = b_2$. Thus, $g(b_1) = g(f(a_1)) = a_1$ and $g(b_2) = g(f(a_2)) = a_2$. Since $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$, we have $a_1 = a_2$, which implies $b_1 = f(a_1) = f(a_2) = b_2$. However, we must consider all $b \\in B$, not just those in the image of f.\n\n## Step ## Step 4: Analyze Statement 2 - The function g must necessarily be surjective.\nFor g to be surjective, every $a \\in A$ must have a corresponding $b \\in B$ such that $g(b) = a$. Given $a \\in A$, we can find $b = f(a)$ such that $g(b) = g(f(a)) = a$. This shows that for every $a \\in A$, there exists a $b \\in B$ (namely, $f(a)$) such that $g(b) = a$, making g surjective.\n\n## Step ## Step 5: Consider the implications of $g(f(a)) = a$ on the injectivity and surjectivity of f and g.\nSince $g(f(a)) = a$ for all $a \\in A$, it implies that f is injective because if $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$, then $g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2))$, hence $a_1 = a_2$. This condition also implies that g is surjective as shown in Step 4 because for any $a$, there's a $b = f(a)$ such that $g(b) = a$. For g to be injective, we need to ensure that if $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$, then $b_1 = b_2$. If $b_1$ and $b_2$ are in the image of f, the condition holds as shown in Step 3. However, we must consider the case when $b$ is not in the image of f.\n\n## Step ## Step 6: Evaluate the necessity of g being injective.\nLet's assume there exists a $b \\in B$ that is not in the image of f. Then, $g(b)$ is some element in A, but there's no $a \\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$. The condition $g(f(a)) = a$ doesn't directly constrain $g(b)$ for such a $b$. However, this doesn't immediately prove g is not injective because we need a counterexample where $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$ but $b_1 \\neq b_2$. If g is not injective, there could be $b_1 \\neq b_2$ with $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$. For g to be injective, it must be that for any $b$, if $g(b) = a$, then $b = f(a)$ because $g(f(a)) = a$. This implies that if $b$ is not $f(a)$ for any $a$, g's value at $b$ is not constrained by $g(f(a)) = a$, potentially allowing $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$ for $b_1 \\neq b_2$ if both are not in the image of f.\n\n## Step ## Step 7: Determine the truth values of Statement 1 and Statement 2 based on the analysis.\nFrom Step 4, we know g is surjective because for every $a \\in A$, there exists $b = f(a)$ such that $g(b) = a$. For injectivity, if $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$, and both $b_1$ and $b_2$ are in the image of f, then $b_1 = b_2$ as shown in Step 3. However, the condition $g(f(a)) = a$ does not directly imply g is injective for all $b \\in B$ because it doesn't constrain g's behavior on elements of B not in the image of f.\n\n## Step ## Step 8: Final analysis on the injectivity of g.\nTo see if g must be injective, consider that if $f$ is not surjective, there are elements in B not in the image of f. For such elements, $g(b)$ can be any element in A, and $g(f(a)) = a$ doesn't constrain $g(b)$ for $b$ not in the image of f. This means g could potentially map different elements of B (not in the image of f) to the same element in A, suggesting g is not necessarily injective.\n\nThe best answer is 3.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.93, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:19:29.843767+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "ad97e071-14d3-4801-8e3c-c55cd12d5253", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "2aafdc15-b69d-43ea-8cec-1578e3bf4804", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}

Statement 2 | There is a field with 60 elements. ### Choices: 0) True, True 1) False, False 2) True, False 3) False, True", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Understand Statement 1\nStatement 1 claims that R (the field of real numbers) is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q (the field of rational numbers). A splitting field of a polynomial over a field F is the smallest field extension of F in which the polynomial splits into linear factors. For R to be a splitting field over Q, there must exist a polynomial in Q[x] such that R is the smallest field containing Q in which this polynomial splits.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Statement 1\nTo determine if R is a splitting field over Q, consider the polynomial $x^2 + 1$. This polynomial does not split in R because it has no real roots. However, R is not the splitting field of $x^2 + 1$ over Q because the splitting field of $x^2 + 1$ over Q is Q(i), which is not R. In fact, R is not the splitting field of any polynomial over Q because it contains transcendental elements (like $\\pi$ and $e$) that are not roots of any non-zero polynomial over Q, and the splitting field of any polynomial over Q is algebraic over Q. However, we should consider that R is not a finite extension of Q, and there are polynomials whose splitting fields are subfields of R, but R itself is not the splitting field of any single polynomial over Q due to its transcendence degree over Q being infinite.\n\n## Step 3: Understand Statement 2\nStatement 2 asserts that there is a field with 60 elements. The number of elements in a finite field is always a power of a prime number ($p^n$, where $p$ is prime and $n$ is a positive integer). To check if there can be a field with 60 elements, we need to see if 60 is a power of a prime.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze Statement 2\n60 is not a power of a prime number because its prime factorization is $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5$. For a field to have 60 elements, 60 must be $p^n$ for some prime $p$ and positive integer $n$. Since 60 is not a prime power, there cannot be a field with 60 elements.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate Statement 1 and Statement 2 Together\nStatement 1 is false because R is not the splitting field of any polynomial over Q; it's too large and contains transcendental elements. Statement 2 is also false because 60 is not a prime power, and thus, there cannot be a field with 60 elements.\n\n## Step 6: Choose the Correct Answer\nGiven that both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false, the correct answer reflects this.\n\nThe best answer is 1.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.993, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:18:08.123314+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "7452cabc-8985-4be2-8873-9d329c4dbfc9", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "1990b943-5d8b-4f0a-9746-6b187903a040", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
