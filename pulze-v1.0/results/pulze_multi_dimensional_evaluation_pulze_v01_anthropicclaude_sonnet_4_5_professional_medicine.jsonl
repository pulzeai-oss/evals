This is significant because fetal urine is a major contributor to amniotic fluid volume, especially in the second and third trimesters.\n\nThe sequence of events would be:\n1. Severe urinary tract malformation (no urethral opening) → inability to void urine\n2. No fetal urine output → oligohydramnios\n3. Oligohydramnios → Potter sequence\n\nPotter sequence (or Potter syndrome) occurs when there is severe oligohydramnios, regardless of the cause. The lack of amniotic fluid leads to:\n- Pulmonary hypoplasia (most critical finding) - because the lungs need amniotic fluid for normal development and the lack of fluid/space restricts chest wall movement\n- Characteristic facial features (Potter facies)\n- Limb deformities\n- Growth restriction\n\nPulmonary hypoplasia is the most life-threatening consequence and is the most common cause of death in Potter sequence.\n\nLet me evaluate the other options:\n- Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Not directly related to urinary tract malformations\n- Intralobar sequestration: A lung malformation not related to oligohydramnios\n- Situs inversus: Mirror-image arrangement of organs, not related to this condition\n\nThe answer is pulmonary hypoplasia (option 2).\n</think>\n\nLooking at this case systematically:\n\n**Key Clinical Features:**\n- Absence of urethral opening (severe urinary tract malformation)\n- Oligohydramnios\n- Stillborn at 32 weeks\n\n**Pathophysiological Sequence:**\n\nThe absence of a urethral opening represents a severe obstructive uropathy that prevents fetal urination.
