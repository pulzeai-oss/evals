It was ended by the catastrophic Thera (Santorini) volcanic eruption around 1500 BCE (dated variably as 1620–1500 BCE in archaeological chronologies), which caused tsunamis, ash fallout, and economic collapse, weakening Minoan society ahead of later Mycenaean influence.

Significant brain growth occurred millions of years later (e.g., in Homo habilis ~2 million years ago) due to factors like diet and social complexity.
