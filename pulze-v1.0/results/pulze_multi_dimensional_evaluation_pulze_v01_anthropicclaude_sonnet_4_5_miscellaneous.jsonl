{"question": "### Question: What substance was used for blood in the famous shower scene from the movie 'Psycho'? ### Choices: 0) tomato juice 1) red wine 2) chocolate syrup 3) ketchup", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "To answer this question, I need to recall facts about the famous shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" (1960).\n\nThe shower scene is one of the most iconic moments in cinema history. A key fact about this scene is that the movie was filmed in black and white. Because of this, the filmmakers needed a substance that would look like blood on black and white film, rather than something that was actually red.\n\nThe substance used was **chocolate syrup** (specifically Bosco chocolate syrup). In black and white cinematography, chocolate syrup had the right consistency and appeared as the perfect shade of dark liquid to represent blood flowing down the drain.\n\nThe answer is: **2) chocolate syrup**", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:33:50.975822+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a1e3787c-8601-4bc7-bd6e-421463a7fcce", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "f9a6c450-62ab-4f04-92c0-0188f4f82149", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
