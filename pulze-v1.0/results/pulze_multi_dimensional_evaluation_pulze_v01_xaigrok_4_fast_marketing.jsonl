{"question": "### Question:  When analysing consumer lifecycles, marketers look at consumers in differing stages of their life. Many models upon which these are based were developed in the 1960s.

Marketers must adapt by targeting \"non-traditional\" households, such as extended single-living phases with higher disposable income for experiences over family goods, or cohabiting pairs delaying big-ticket purchases like homes until later.
