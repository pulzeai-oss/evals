{"question": "### Question: One Sunday afternoon, a sports fan went to a professional football game. While standing in line at a concession stand, he got into an argument with three men ahead of him in the line. The three men were friends attending the game together. One of the men punched the sports fan in the mouth. A fight ensued. During the fracas, one of the other three men hit the sports fan over the head with a bottle, which caused him to suffer a serious concussion. The sports fan does not know for certain which of the three men struck him with the bottle. If the sports fan asserts a claim against the man who punched him in the mouth to recover damages for the head injury, will the sports fan prevail? ### Choices: 0) Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth was the instigator who struck the first blow that started the fracas. 1) Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth and the other men were acting in concert. 2) No, because the man who punched him in the mouth did not actually strike the sports fan with the bottle. 3) No, because the sports fan cannot offer proof as to which of the men struck the sports fan over the head with the bottle.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "**Answer: 2) No, because the man who punched him in the mouth did not actually strike the sports fan with the bottle.**", "answering_model": "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b", "overall_score": 0.714, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:55:16.015695+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "c9408f5b-70d7-4400-924d-c2698a9f2cd3", "evaluation_run_id": "55c9d212-ef47-4102-8350-c68f2d30c738", "dataset_item_id": "f66dba9d-78be-4c00-b954-a9164bc7e272", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 0, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 5, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 5}

{"question": "### Question: A statute passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President authorizes a federal agency to select a site for and to construct a monument honoring members of the capitol police force killed in the line of duty. The statute appropriates the necessary funds but provides that the funds may not be expended until both houses of Congress have adopted a concurrent resolution, not subject to presentment to the President, approving the agency's plans for the monument's location and design. Is the provision requiring further congressional approval before expenditure of the funds constitutional? ### Choices: 0) No, because decisions regarding the placement and design of government-owned structures are an exclusively executive function with which Congress may not interfere by any means. 1) No, because the provision amounts to an unconstitutional legislative interference with an executive function. 2) Yes, because Congress may attach reasonable conditions to its appropriation of funds to executive departments, and its special interest in the members of its own police force makes the provision a reasonable condition. 3) Yes, because the provision is part of a statute that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "**Answer: 1) No, because the provision amounts to an unconstitutional legislative interference with an executive function.**", "answering_model": "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:58:05.381954+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "89fb6acd-d5ce-4896-aa30-f2ed3a99265a", "evaluation_run_id": "55c9d212-ef47-4102-8350-c68f2d30c738", "dataset_item_id": "5b44f5f8-458b-4152-808a-64ca044aa826", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
