This net loss of \"free water\" concentrates the sodium in the remaining body fluid, leading to a high sodium level. Therefore, it is fundamentally a state where water intake is less than what is needed to maintain balance.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:19:51.683298+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "cac5f14b-7a4f-4a98-848d-a442830c7fc3", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "3e006baa-76ad-4611-9750-08c27760be94", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

The standard reference point for an accurate blood pressure reading is the level of the heart.\n\n*   **Arm above heart level:** When the arm is raised above the heart, gravity pulls blood downwards, away from the arm. This results in a lower hydrostatic pressure in the brachial artery, leading to a falsely low blood pressure reading (an underestimation).\n*   **Arm below heart level:** Conversely, if the arm is positioned below the heart, gravity will cause blood to pool in the arm, increasing the hydrostatic pressure and leading to a falsely high blood pressure reading (an overestimation).\n\nFor every inch (2.5 cm) the arm is above or below the heart level, the blood pressure reading will be off by approximately 2 mmHg.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:24:45.353713+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "b20ffc6a-2065-4113-82e3-628e23fe76d4", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "07be2d89-8e28-48fc-a51e-1f8366ae15eb", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

A palpable median groove is a feature of a normal or benignly enlarged prostate. The loss or obliteration of this groove can be a sign of malignancy, making it an adverse finding.\n*   **1) Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour:** This is **true**. A hard mass of impacted stool felt on digital rectal examination can feel firm and irregular, mimicking the characteristics of a rectal carcinoma. A key differentiating feature is that faeces can often be indented with pressure, whereas a tumour is typically hard and fixed.\n*   **2) A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless:** This is **false**. A thrombosed external haemorrhoid (a blood clot within the haemorrhoid) is acutely and often severely painful.\n*   **3) Peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy:** This is **false**. \"Peri-anal\" means around the anus.

{"question": "### Question: The maximum sustainable power: ### Choices: 0) usually remains constant during a race. 1) declines with the distance of the race. 2) is improved by a high fat diet. 3) is inversely related to muscle glycogen content.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **1) declines with the distance of the race.**\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Maximum Sustainable Power and Duration:** Maximum sustainable power (often related to concepts like Functional Threshold Power or Critical Power) is the highest power output an athlete can maintain for a specific duration. There is an inverse relationship between the intensity (power) and the duration for which it can be sustained.\n    *   For a short race (e.g., a 1-mile run or a 5-minute cycling effort), an athlete can sustain a very high power output.\n    *   For a long race (e.g., a marathon or a 100-mile bike race), the average power output that can be sustained for the entire event is significantly lower.\n    *   Therefore, as the distance (and thus the duration) of the race increases, the maximum sustainable power for that event declines.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **0) usually remains constant during a race:** This is incorrect. An athlete's ability to produce power decreases over the course of a race due to fatigue, glycogen depletion, and other physiological factors. While athletes aim for a relatively steady pace/power, their maximum potential power at any given moment is declining.\n*   **2) is improved by a high fat diet:** This is generally false for efforts near the maximum sustainable power. High-intensity exercise relies heavily on carbohydrates (glycogen) as the primary fuel source because it can be metabolized much more quickly than fat. A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet can impair performance at these higher intensities. While fat adaptation can be useful for ultra-endurance events, it typically does not improve maximum sustainable power at lactate threshold.\n*   **3) is inversely related to muscle glycogen content:** This is the opposite of the truth. Muscle glycogen is the main fuel for sustained, high-intensity exercise. A higher level of muscle glycogen allows an athlete to sustain a higher power output for a longer period. Therefore, maximum sustainable power is **directly** related to muscle glycogen content. When glycogen is depleted (\"bonking\"), the ability to sustain power drops dramatically.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.9857142857142858, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:20:24.821777+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "eaabd76d-1355-44b4-96ac-eb0d07cf6f81", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "ce8bcb35-adf9-4ced-becf-d206b16bcc0b", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Melaena is the passage of black, tarry stools, which indicates an upper gastrointestinal bleed (e.g., from the stomach or duodenum). The blood has been altered by digestive enzymes. Bleeding from haemorrhoids is typically fresh, bright red blood (hematochezia) because it originates from the lower gastrointestinal tract and has not been digested.\n\n*   **1) Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids:** This is **true**. During pregnancy, several factors increase the risk of developing haemorrhoids:\n    *   The growing uterus increases pressure on the pelvic veins, impeding blood return.\n    *   Hormonal changes (increased progesterone) can cause the walls of veins to relax, making them more likely to swell.\n    *   Constipation, which is common in pregnancy, leads to straining during bowel movements, which increases pressure on the haemorrhoidal veins.\n\n*   **2) Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is associated with pain:** This is **false**. First-degree haemorrhoids are internal haemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapse. Because they are located above the dentate line where there are no pain-sensing nerves, the bleeding is characteristically **painless**. Pain is more commonly associated with thrombosed external haemorrhoids or strangulated internal haemorrhoids.\n\n*   **3) Second degree haemorrhoids cannot be returned to the anal canal:** This is **false**. This statement describes fourth-degree haemorrhoids. The grading of internal haemorrhoids is as follows:\n    *   **First degree:** Bleed but do not prolapse.\n    *   **Second degree:** Prolapse upon straining but reduce (return to the anal canal) **spontaneously**.\n    *   **Third degree:** Prolapse and require **manual reduction** (must be pushed back in).\n    *   **Fourth degree:** Are permanently prolapsed and **cannot be reduced**.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:24:45.455273+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "3c763966-ca73-480a-ab5c-310efddeb129", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "ae71104c-3ad7-4a7e-b398-ff77f1e23c1b", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
