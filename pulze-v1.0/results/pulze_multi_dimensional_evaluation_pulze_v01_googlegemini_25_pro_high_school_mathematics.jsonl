Translate the problem into mathematical equations.**\n\nLet the two positive integers be $x$ and $y$.\nThe problem gives us the following information:\n*   The product of the integers is 56:\n    $x \\cdot y = 56$\n*   One integer is smaller than the other, let's say $x < y$.

Understand the relationship between the product of divisors and the number of divisors.**\n\nLet `n` be a positive integer. Let `d(n)` be the number of positive divisors of `n`. The product of the positive divisors of `n`, let's call it `P(n)`, is given by the formula:\n`P(n) = n^(d(n)/2)`\n\n*Why is this true?*\nLet the divisors of `n` be `d_1, d_2, ..., d_k` in increasing order, where `k = d(n)`. So, `1 = d_1 < d_2 < ... < d_k = n`.\nThe product is `P(n) = d_1 * d_2 * ... * d_k`.\nIf we pair the divisors, the first with the last, the second with the second to last, and so on, the product of each pair is `n`.\n`d_1 * d_k = 1 * n = n`\n`d_2 * d_{k-1} = n`\n...\nThere are `k` divisors in total.
