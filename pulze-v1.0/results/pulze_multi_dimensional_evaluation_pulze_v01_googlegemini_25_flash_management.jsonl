It is a **contingent concept**, meaning it depends on various factors within an organization. There is no single, universally optimal number that applies to all situations.\n\nFactors that influence the optimal span of control include:\n\n*   **Nature of the work:** Routine and standardized tasks allow for a wider span; complex and varied tasks require a narrower span.\n*   **Competence of the manager:** Highly skilled and experienced managers can handle a wider span.\n*   **Competence and training of subordinates:** Well-trained and self-sufficient employees require less supervision, allowing for a wider span.\n*   **Organizational culture:** A culture of empowerment and trust can support a wider span.\n*   **Use of technology:** Effective communication and information systems can enable a wider span.\n*   **Geographic dispersion:** Subordinates located in different places usually require a narrower span.\n*   **Need for coordination:** High interdependence among tasks might necessitate a narrower span for closer supervision.\n\nWhile numbers like 5 or 7 are often cited as common or traditional guidelines, they are not universally \"optimal.\" Modern management often leans towards wider spans of control due to better-trained employees and technology, but this is still context-dependent.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:41:18.230722+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "65e8b189-1236-4ec5-9642-e73e1c31e933", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "29aaa24c-65f4-4632-8c2a-45416dab1dc2", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **0) Team members can be recruited for their specific skills or experience.** This is a major advantage of virtual teams. Geographic boundaries are removed, allowing companies to hire the best talent globally, regardless of location.\n*   **1) No overhead costs associated with physical buildings.** Virtual teams often work remotely, significantly reducing or eliminating the need for office space, utilities, and other building-related expenses. This is a significant cost advantage.\n*   **2) Conflict can be resolved easily using face-to-face meetings.** This is **not** an advantage of a virtual team. Virtual teams are geographically dispersed, making spontaneous or frequent face-to-face meetings difficult, costly, and often impractical. Conflict resolution in virtual teams can actually be *more challenging* due to the lack of non-verbal cues and the absence of in-person interaction.\n*   **3) Low transport or commuting costs.** Since team members work from different locations (often their homes), they do not incur daily commuting costs, and the company doesn't bear these costs either. This is an advantage.\n\nTherefore, the statement that conflict can be resolved easily using face-to-face meetings is not an advantage of a virtual team; in fact, it highlights a potential challenge.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:53:59.180820+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "bdfa8059-cf41-4e0f-8f1c-abfff5dc7697", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "02a4d55d-bb95-4604-b9fb-871043ebee98", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
