{"question": "### Question: The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of: ### Choices: 0) a deletion. 1) a duplication. 2) a substitution. 3) an insertion.", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "<think>\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator). Let me think about the most common mutation.\n\nThe most common cystic fibrosis mutation is known as ΔF508 (delta F508) or F508del. This mutation involves the loss of three nucleotides from the CFTR gene, which results in the deletion of a single amino acid - phenylalanine - at position 508 of the CFTR protein.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n0) A deletion - The ΔF508 mutation is indeed a deletion. Specifically, it's a deletion of three base pairs (CTT) in the DNA sequence, which leads to the loss of phenylalanine at position 508. This accounts for approximately 70% of all CF mutations worldwide (though the percentage varies by population).\n\n1) A duplication - This would involve copying a segment of DNA. This is not the most common CF mutation.\n\n2) A substitution - This would involve replacing one nucleotide with another. While substitution mutations do occur in CF, they are not the most common type.\n\n3) An insertion - This would involve adding extra nucleotides. This is not the most common CF mutation.\n\nThe answer is clearly a deletion (option 0).\n</think>\n\nThe most common cystic fibrosis mutation is **ΔF508 (delta F508)**, also written as F508del.\n\nThis mutation involves:\n- **A deletion of three nucleotides (CTT)** from the CFTR gene\n- Results in the loss of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR protein\n- Accounts for approximately **70% of CF mutations** worldwide (though percentages vary by ethnic population)\n\nThe deletion causes the CFTR protein to misfold, leading to its degradation before reaching the cell membrane, which impairs chloride ion transport and causes the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Answer: 0) a deletion**", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:22:48.168688+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "ac736393-4047-4bc5-a603-ab40ffb396d6", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "0c26aff1-fec7-4edd-99e0-f9cc60619ee4", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
