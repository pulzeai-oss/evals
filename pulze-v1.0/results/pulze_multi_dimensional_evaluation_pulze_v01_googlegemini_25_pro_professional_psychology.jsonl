They are in one group or the other, but not both. This factor has **two levels**: (1) cognitive behavioral and (2) brief dynamic.\n*   **Factor 2: Time of Assessment.** This is a **within-subjects factor** (also called a repeated-measures factor) because *all* participants are assessed at both time points. The same individuals are measured twice. This factor also has **two levels**: (1) pretest and (2) posttest.\n\nNow let's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **0) A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) could be used to analyze the data:** This is correct. A mixed model (or mixed-design) ANOVA is the appropriate statistical test for a design that includes at least one between-subjects factor and at least one within-subjects factor.\n*   **1) The design includes one between-subjects factor and one within-subjects factor:** This is correct, as explained above. The treatment type is the between-subjects factor, and the time of assessment is the within-subjects factor.\n*   **2) Each factor comprises two levels:** This is also correct.

{"question": "### Question: A colleague, a licensed psychologist, confides in you that he has just ended a sexual relationship with one of his clients.

As an ethical psychologist, you should: ### Choices: 0) file a complaint against the colleague immediately with the Ethics Committee. 1) file a complaint against the colleague with the Ethics Committee after informing him that you intend to do so. 2) discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take. 3) contact the client and discuss the matter with her.", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "This is a classic ethics question that tests knowledge of the APA Ethics Code, specifically how to handle ethical violations by colleagues.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n\n*   **The Core Ethical Violation:** A sexual relationship with a current client is one of the most serious ethical violations a psychologist can commit (APA Ethics Code Standard 10.05). It involves exploitation, a breach of trust, and has a high potential for significant harm to the client.\n*   **Your Ethical Obligation:** When you become aware of a serious ethical violation by a colleague, you have an obligation to act. The APA Ethics Code provides a framework for this.\n    *   **Standard 1.04 (Informal Resolution of Ethical Violations):** This standard suggests that when appropriate, the first step is to attempt an informal resolution by bringing the issue to the attention of the colleague. The goal is to see if the colleague will take appropriate corrective action.\n    *   **Standard 1.05 (Reporting Ethical Violations):** This standard states that if a violation has caused or is likely to cause \"substantial harm\" and is *not* appropriate for informal resolution or is not resolved properly through informal means, then a formal report to an ethics committee or licensing board is necessary.\n\n### Evaluating the Choices based on the Ethical Code:\n\n1.  **0) file a complaint against the colleague immediately with the Ethics Committee.** This action skips the step of informal resolution. While the violation is severe, the colleague has *confided* in you, creating an opportunity for a direct conversation. The standard procedure is to attempt informal resolution first, unless it's clearly inappropriate or would violate confidentiality.\n2.  **1) file a complaint against the colleague with the Ethics Committee after informing him that you intend to do so.** This is similar to option 0. It is a formal action and still bypasses the crucial step of discussing the colleague's own plans for remediation.\n3.  **2) discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take.** This is the correct first step according to the principle of informal resolution (Standard 1.04). The colleague has opened the door by confiding in you. Your initial responsibility is to address the issue with him directly, assess his understanding of the gravity of his actions, and determine what steps he plans to take to rectify the situation (e.g., self-report to the licensing board, ensure the client receives appropriate care from an unbiased provider, seek supervision/therapy for himself). If his response is inadequate or he plans to do nothing, you would then be obligated to escalate to a formal report (Standard 1.05).\n4.  **3) contact the client and discuss the matter with her.** This would be a major ethical breach. You have no therapeutic relationship with this client. Contacting her would violate the confidentiality of your colleague's disclosure to you and would be an inappropriate and potentially harmful intrusion into her life. Protecting the client is paramount, but it must be done through the proper professional channels (i.e., the colleague and/or the ethics board).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe most appropriate initial action is to follow the principle of informal resolution. You should first discuss the matter with your colleague to understand his perspective and what corrective actions he intends to take.\n\n**The correct choice is 2) discuss the matter further with the colleague to see what course of action he plans to take.**", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:00:33.728160+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "36e55e48-1364-451d-9c20-093869718656", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "7e93a027-ef13-4494-a415-e9983abee5c6", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
