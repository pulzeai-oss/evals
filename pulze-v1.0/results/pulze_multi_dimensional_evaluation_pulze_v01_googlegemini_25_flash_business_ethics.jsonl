This is a major ethical concern for them.\n    *   **Food and packaging waste:** Supermarkets generate enormous amounts of food waste (due to spoilage, expiry, damage) and packaging waste from the products they sell and their own operations.\n    *   **Supply chain CO2 emissions:** Supermarkets have vast supply chains, transporting food from farms and factories globally to their stores, resulting in significant CO2 emissions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three issues are highly relevant to the supermarket industry.\n\n*   **1) Chemicals industry:** Their primary ethical concerns would be related to chemical safety, environmental pollution from their processes, and worker safety, not directly consumer food choices or food waste.\n\n*   **2) Construction industry:** Their ethical issues revolve around safety, environmental impact of building materials, waste from construction and demolition, and labor practices, not food consumption or food waste.\n\n*   **3) Information and mobile technology industry:** Their ethical concerns include data privacy, e-waste, labor conditions in manufacturing, and energy consumption of devices/data centers, not food-related issues.\n\nTherefore, the **Supermarket industry** is the most fitting answer as it directly faces all the listed business ethics issues.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.993, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:36:32.423600+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "ca749541-a044-48e7-bded-b52abd0e675e", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "687c96f2-e1ff-4f47-bce1-8ccc7376db99", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

While the broader concept of \"stakeholders\" (including employees, customers, suppliers, community) is important in business ethics, the primary legal and financial responsibility is typically to the shareholders.\n\n2.  **\"Specifically, they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company, as well as a duty of ________ and of _______.\"**\n    *   These refer to specific legal duties of directors and officers.\n    *   **Duty of Care and Skill:** This duty requires managers to act with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise in a similar position and circumstances.
