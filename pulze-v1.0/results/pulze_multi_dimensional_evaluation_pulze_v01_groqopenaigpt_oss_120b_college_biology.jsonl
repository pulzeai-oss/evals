This mirrors the citric acid cycle, where oxaloacetate is regenerated each turn (acetyl‑CoA + oxaloacetate → citrate, and after the subsequent steps oxaloacetate is re‑formed). Thus, ornithine’s regeneration is analogous to that of oxaloacetate.", "answering_model": "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:19:27.680058+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "3d29840d-7adb-4c52-95a3-937acf212ecb", "evaluation_run_id": "55c9d212-ef47-4102-8350-c68f2d30c738", "dataset_item_id": "00405356-b344-4d1a-9ce8-e9f80ab880f2", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
