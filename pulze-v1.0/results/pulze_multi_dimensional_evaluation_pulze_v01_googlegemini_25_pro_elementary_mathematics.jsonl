Start with the given equation:**\nx − 10.5 = −11.6\n\n**2. Isolate the variable 'x'.**\nTo get 'x' by itself on one side of the equation, you need to undo the subtraction of 10.5. The opposite of subtracting 10.5 is adding 10.5. Add 10.5 to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced.\n\nx − 10.5 + 10.5 = −11.6 + 10.5\n\n**3.
