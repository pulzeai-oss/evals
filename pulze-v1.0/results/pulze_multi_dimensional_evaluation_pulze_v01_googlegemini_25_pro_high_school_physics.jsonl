According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, this force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the Earth.\n    *   Formula: Weight (W) = G * (M * m) / r²\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n        *   M is the mass of the Earth.\n        *   m is the mass of the textbook.\n        *   r is the distance from the center of the Earth to the object.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Weight at sea level (W_sea) = 30 N\n    *   Radius of the Earth (R_earth) = 6,400 km\n    *   Height of the mountain (h) = 6,000 m\n\n3.  **Convert Units to be Consistent:**\n    It's easiest to work with the same units. Let's convert the mountain's height to kilometers.\n    *   h = 6,000 m = 6 km\n\n4.  **Calculate the Distances from the Earth's Center:**\n    *   Distance at sea level (r_sea) = Radius of the Earth = 6,400 km\n    *   Distance on the mountain peak (r_mountain) = Radius of the Earth + height of the mountain = 6,400 km + 6 km = 6,406 km\n\n5.  **Analyze the Change in Distance:**\n    The distance from the center of the Earth increases from 6,400 km to 6,406 km.

The man's weight is the gravitational force that the **Earth** exerts on the **man**.

The force of the man on the scale is the reaction force to the *normal force* of the scale on the man. In this scenario (accelerating upward), the scale pushes up on the man with a force greater than his weight, so the man pushes down on the scale with a force greater than his weight.
