In this scenario, the mean is calculated as the average of the values, which equals the common value (e.g., 5), and thus does not necessarily equal zero.\n\nNext, the standard deviation is examined, which quantifies the spread of data around the mean. With all values identical, there is no variation from the mean, resulting in a standard deviation of zero.\n\nVariance, defined as the square of the standard deviation, follows directly: if the standard deviation is zero, the variance must also be zero.\n\nThe range is then evaluated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Since all values are the same, the maximum equals the minimum, making the range zero.\n\nTherefore, while standard deviation, variance, and range must equal zero, the mean does not, identifying it as the exception.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 0.94, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:54:46.100920+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "f1d84b6e-b097-42df-91e2-347872a84c1c", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "0a016cab-e39b-4484-be3f-98740dfaaa7f", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}

Option C (one-sample z-test on differences) applies to paired data, which is not indicated here.
