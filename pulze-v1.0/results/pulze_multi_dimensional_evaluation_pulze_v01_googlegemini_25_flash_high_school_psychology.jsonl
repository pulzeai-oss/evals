This is thought to occur because these words have more time to be rehearsed and transferred into **long-term memory (LTM)**.\n2.  **Recency Effect:** People tend to remember words at the **end** of a list better. This is thought to occur because these words are still fresh in **short-term memory (STM)** or working memory at the time of immediate recall.\n\nNow, consider the \"two days later\" aspect:\n*   **Short-term memory (STM)** has a very limited duration (seconds to a minute without rehearsal). After two days, any information held in STM would have long since decayed or been displaced. Therefore, the **recency effect would disappear** with a delayed recall.\n*   **Long-term memory (LTM)** is responsible for retaining information over extended periods. The **primacy effect**, which is linked to the transfer of information into LTM, would still be evident.\n\nTherefore, if Dan remembers words two days later, those words must have been encoded into his long-term memory.

While parents are expected to provide support and guidance, the ultimate academic outcome is often seen as the student's own responsibility. There might be concern or disappointment, but direct societal \"accountability\" for a 17-year-old's failure would typically be less intense on the parents compared to some other cultures.\n\n*   **Japanese society**, on the other hand, has a very strong emphasis on education and academic achievement. There is significant parental involvement and pressure, often extending through high school. The concept of \"kyoiku mama\" (education mother) highlights the intense dedication many mothers have to their children's schooling. Academic success is often tied to family honor and reputation. Therefore, if a 17-year-old student were failing, the parents would likely face considerable societal pressure and be held highly accountable for not ensuring their child's success.\n\nGiven these cultural differences, Japanese society would most likely hold the parents accountable.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:43:34.760380+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "522559bb-ba3d-41f3-aebc-91f1b7001716", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "337b3463-1fb0-4260-b642-01703cb44bfa", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

This means the 84th percentile is roughly 115 (50% + 34%).\n    *   Approximately 95% of people score within 2 standard deviations of the mean (between 70 and 130).

{"question": "### Question: A medication prescribed by a psychiatrist for major depressive disorder would most likely influence the balance of which of the following neurotransmitters? ### Choices: 0) serotonin 1) dopamine 2) acetylcholine 3) thorazine", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "The question asks which neurotransmitter is most likely influenced by medication for major depressive disorder.\n\n1.  **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)** is strongly associated with imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, norepinephrine, and to some extent, dopamine.\n2.  **Antidepressant medications** are designed to correct these imbalances. The most common class of antidepressants, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), work by increasing the availability of serotonin in the brain. Other antidepressants, like SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), target both serotonin and norepinephrine.\n3.  Let's evaluate the choices:\n    *   **0) Serotonin:** This neurotransmitter plays a crucial role in mood, sleep, appetite, and well-being. Low levels of serotonin are strongly linked to depression, and most antidepressant medications (especially SSRIs) primarily target serotonin. This is the most likely answer.\n    *   **1) Dopamine:** While dopamine is involved in reward, motivation, and pleasure, and some atypical antidepressants can affect it, it's not the *primary* or *most common* target for *most* antidepressant medications for MDD compared to serotonin. Dopamine is more prominently associated with conditions like Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.\n    *   **2) Acetylcholine:** This neurotransmitter is primarily involved in muscle contraction, learning, and memory. While it has some indirect roles in mood, it is not the primary neurotransmitter targeted by typical antidepressant medications for MDD. It's more associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n    *   **3) Thorazine:** This is a *medication* (chlorpromazine), not a neurotransmitter. It is an antipsychotic drug primarily used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, working by blocking dopamine receptors. Therefore, it is an incorrect choice for a neurotransmitter.\n\nBased on the primary mechanisms of action of common antidepressant medications, serotonin is the neurotransmitter most directly and commonly influenced for the treatment of major depressive disorder.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:49:14.714877+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "27c22c9c-bbfb-4062-8b3f-5f148c34fcef", "evaluation_run_id": "adbcdf17-d80b-496c-9b0d-a2eb361002f9", "dataset_item_id": "2304bf75-5815-4a91-9679-0915e8ebca03", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
