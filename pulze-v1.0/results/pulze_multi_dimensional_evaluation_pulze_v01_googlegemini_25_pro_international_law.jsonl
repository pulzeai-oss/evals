{"question": "### Question: What is the relationship between the formal sources of international law? ### Choices: 0) There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law 1) Treaties supersede custom 2) Custom supersedes treaties 3) General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **0) There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law**.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\nThe formal sources of international law are most authoritatively listed in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). These are:\na. International conventions (treaties)\nb. International custom\nc. The general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\n\nThe prevailing view among international legal scholars and practitioners is that there is no formal, *a priori* hierarchy among these three primary sources. They are considered to be of equal normative value.\n\n*   **Treaties vs. Custom:** Neither source automatically supersedes the other. A treaty can codify existing custom, or a later custom can modify an earlier treaty. In case of a conflict, legal principles like *lex specialis derogat legi generali* (a specific rule prevails over a general rule) or *lex posterior derogat legi priori* (a later rule prevails over an earlier one) are applied to determine which rule governs a particular situation, rather than relying on a fixed hierarchy of sources.\n\n*   **General Principles of Law:** These are typically used to fill gaps when treaties or custom do not provide a clear rule. They are not considered superior to the other two sources.\n\nThe only recognized hierarchy in international law involves **peremptory norms (jus cogens)**. These are fundamental principles of international law (like the prohibition of genocide, slavery, and torture) from which no derogation is permitted. A treaty that conflicts with a *jus cogens* norm is void. However, *jus cogens* is a quality that a norm (usually of customary law) can have, rather than being a separate source in itself.\n\nTherefore, the general rule is that the formal sources themselves are not in a hierarchical relationship.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:24:14.714795+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "fc7e56d1-f817-4131-acc6-7b589209c92e", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "c4799b6a-80bc-4192-abd8-5508590c0e49", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

It argues that the UN Security Council (UNSC) can authorise the use of force implicitly, without a new, explicit resolution.\n*   The argument typically relies on a sequence of events:\n    1.  The UNSC passes a resolution that finds a state in breach of its obligations, demands compliance, and **forewarns** of \"serious consequences\" or authorises \"all necessary means\" if the state fails to comply (e.g., Resolution 678 regarding Iraq's invasion of Kuwait).\n    2.  A ceasefire or subsequent resolution is passed, but the state continues to violate its obligations.\n    3.  Proponents of implied authorisation argue that the original warning or authorisation can be \"revived.\" They claim that a new resolution finding the state in further breach is sufficient to trigger the original authorisation for the use of force, without the need for a second, explicit resolution saying \"we now authorise the use of force.\"\n\nTherefore, option 0 best captures this meaning: it is a **presumption** of approval based on a prior **forewarning** by the Security Council.
