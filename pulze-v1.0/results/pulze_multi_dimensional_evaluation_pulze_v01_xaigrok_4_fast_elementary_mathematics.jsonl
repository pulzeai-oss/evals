{"question": "### Question: Lucy is counting by 2s. She starts with the number 2 and stops at the number 50. Which number would Lucy not count? ### Choices: 0) 11 1) 22 2) 34 3) 48", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "A) 11\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe reasoning begins by identifying Lucy's counting pattern: she counts by 2s starting from 2 and stopping at 50, generating the sequence of even numbers 2, 4, 6, ..., 50.  \n\nNext, the choices are evaluated against this sequence:  \n- 11 is odd and thus not part of the even-number sequence.  \n- 22 is even and falls within the range from 2 to 50, so it is included.  \n- 34 is even and within the range, so it is included.  \n- 48 is even and within the range, so it is included.  \n\nTherefore, 11 is the only number among the choices that does not appear in the sequence.", "answering_model": "xai/grok-4-fast", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:18:38.590152+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "a1a88bbc-797f-470e-a226-98f18354b8b3", "evaluation_run_id": "b573e9eb-b532-4cbc-a21a-1bcf0cfbd556", "dataset_item_id": "b009acbb-d756-4f4a-9fba-cc1b407b2d1f", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

How many students take tap lessons? ### Choices: 0) 32 1) 49 2) 63 3) 68", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "0) 32\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe phrase \"4 over 9\" represents the fraction 4/9, indicating that 4/9 of the students take tap lessons. With a total of 72 students, calculate the number taking tap lessons by multiplying: (4/9) × 72. First, divide 72 by 9 to get 8. Then, multiply 8 by 4 to obtain 32.

{"question": "### Question: Each time Rami turned the dial on a machine, the dial moved 1 degree. Rami turned the dial 10 times.

The problem specifies that each turn of the dial results in a 1-degree movement.  \n2. Rami performs this action 10 times, so the total movement is calculated by multiplying the movement per turn by the number of turns: 1 degree/turn × 10 turns = 10 degrees.  \n3. Other choices (90, 110, 360) represent common distractors, such as approximations of a full circle (360 degrees) or unrelated angles, but they do not align with the given information of 1 degree per turn.  \n4.
