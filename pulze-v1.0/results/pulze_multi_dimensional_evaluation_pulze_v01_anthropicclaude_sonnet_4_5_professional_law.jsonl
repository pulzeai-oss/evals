{"question": "### Question: A statute passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President authorizes a federal agency to select a site for and to construct a monument honoring members of the capitol police force killed in the line of duty. The statute appropriates the necessary funds but provides that the funds may not be expended until both houses of Congress have adopted a concurrent resolution, not subject to presentment to the President, approving the agency's plans for the monument's location and design. Is the provision requiring further congressional approval before expenditure of the funds constitutional? ### Choices: 0) No, because decisions regarding the placement and design of government-owned structures are an exclusively executive function with which Congress may not interfere by any means. 1) No, because the provision amounts to an unconstitutional legislative interference with an executive function. 2) Yes, because Congress may attach reasonable conditions to its appropriation of funds to executive departments, and its special interest in the members of its own police force makes the provision a reasonable condition. 3) Yes, because the provision is part of a statute that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "<analysis>\n\nThis question deals with the separation of powers and the constitutionality of a legislative veto mechanism.\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- Congress passed and the President signed a statute authorizing a federal agency to build a monument\n- Funds were appropriated but cannot be spent until both houses pass a concurrent resolution approving the plans\n- This concurrent resolution is NOT subject to presentment to the President\n\n**Legal Issue:**\nThis is a classic legislative veto problem, directly addressed by INS v. Chadha (1983).\n\n**Analysis of Chadha:**\nIn INS v. Chadha, the Supreme Court held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional because they violate:\n1. **Bicameralism** - requiring passage by both houses (though this is satisfied here)\n2. **Presentment** - requiring presentation to the President for signature or veto\n\nThe critical flaw here is that the concurrent resolution is \"not subject to presentment to the President.\" This allows Congress to exercise legislative power (controlling the expenditure of appropriated funds) without following the constitutional requirements of Article I, Section 7.\n\n**Evaluating the Choices:**\n\n0) **Too broad** - Congress can interfere with executive functions through proper legislative means (passing laws with presentment)\n\n1) **CORRECT** - This is unconstitutional legislative interference because it bypasses the presentment requirement, violating Chadha\n\n2) **Incorrect** - While Congress can attach conditions to appropriations, those conditions must be in the original statute (subject to presentment), not through subsequent legislative action that bypasses presentment\n\n3) **Incorrect** - The fact that the original statute was properly enacted doesn't cure the constitutional defect in the mechanism it creates for future congressional action\n\n**Answer: Choice 1**\n\nThe provision is an unconstitutional legislative veto that allows Congress to control executive action without presentment to the President.\n\n</analysis>\n\nThe answer is **1**.\n\nThis provision violates the separation of powers as established in INS v. Chadha (1983). While Congress properly passed the initial statute with presentment to the President, the mechanism requiring a concurrent resolution (without presentment) to approve expenditure of already-appropriated funds constitutes an unconstitutional legislative veto. Congress cannot retain control over the execution of laws through mechanisms that bypass the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment. If Congress wants to control how these funds are spent, it must do so through properly enacted legislation subject to presidential review.", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:50:14.003135+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "e43176da-fd3a-4dd2-a458-31a1eeb2bc21", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "5b44f5f8-458b-4152-808a-64ca044aa826", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

For acting in concert, there must be:\n   - A common plan or design\n   - Mutual assistance or encouragement\n   - Participation in the tortious conduct\n\n2. **Causation**: Generally, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant caused the injury.\n\n3. **Alternative liability (Summers v.
