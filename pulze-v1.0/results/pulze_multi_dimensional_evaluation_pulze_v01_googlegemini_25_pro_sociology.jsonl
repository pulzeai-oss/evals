{"question": "### Question: Marxist feminists explain patriarchy in terms of: ### Choices: 0) a lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women 1) sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically and sexually 2) women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy 3) the dual systems of capitalism and male domination", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **2) women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why, and an explanation of the other choices:\n\n*   **2) women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy (Correct Answer):** This is the core argument of Marxist feminism. They argue that capitalism benefits from women's unpaid domestic work (childcare, cooking, cleaning). This labor reproduces the next generation of workers and maintains the current workforce (by caring for male workers) at no cost to the capitalist employer. This economic exploitation within the home is seen as the foundation of women's oppression in society.\n\n*   **0) a lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women:** This is the perspective of **Liberal Feminism**. Liberal feminists focus on achieving gender equality through legal and social reforms within the existing system, rather than overthrowing the system itself.\n\n*   **1) sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically and sexually:** This is the central idea of **Radical Feminism**. Radical feminists see patriarchy as the primary and most fundamental form of oppression, where men as a \"sex class\" dominate women. They believe this system is independent of, and often predates, capitalism.\n\n*   **3) the dual systems of capitalism and male domination:** This describes **Socialist Feminism** (or Dual-Systems Feminism). This perspective tries to synthesize Marxist and Radical feminist ideas, arguing that women are oppressed by two distinct but intertwined systems: capitalism and patriarchy. They believe one cannot be understood without the other.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T22:05:24.551097+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "8e64227a-d833-453d-9958-55f979069b5e", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "d089a9d1-ddfe-40fd-b880-726587d96919", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

The **'service class'** (or *salariat*) is at the top of this schema.\n\nIts key characteristics are:\n*   **Occupation:** They are higher-grade professionals, managers, and administrators in non-manual occupations.\n*   **Employment Relationship:** They have a \"service relationship\" with their employer, which is based on trust and delegated authority. They are not paid simply for the hours they work (like the working class) but receive a salary and have career prospects, job security, and other benefits in exchange for their loyalty and commitment to the employing organization.\n*   **Function:** They exercise authority and expertise on behalf of their employer, which could be a private corporation or, as the choice specifies, the state (e.g., senior civil servants).\n\nWhile the service class exists in both the public and private sectors, choice 0 captures the core elements of being in a non-manual, authoritative position, making it the best description among the options provided.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:53:10.734269+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "eeb91df7-cd1e-4820-836a-0ab5c16144bc", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "83ec0398-83f1-4535-9ba5-41a963ec2c6f", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: Sociology differs from common sense in that: ### Choices: 0) it focuses on the researchers' own experiences 1) it makes little distinction between the way the world is and the way it ought to be 2) its knowledge is accumulated from many different research contexts 3) it is subjective and biased", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **2) its knowledge is accumulated from many different research contexts**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Sociology** is a social science that uses systematic methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about human social structure and activity. This knowledge is built over time by many different researchers studying various societies and groups.\n*   **Common sense** refers to the everyday, taken-for-granted beliefs and assumptions we have about the social world. It's often based on limited personal experience, anecdotes, and cultural traditions, not on systematic research.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **0) it focuses on the researchers' own experiences:** This is the opposite of what sociology aims to do. While a researcher's experience might inspire a topic, sociological research requires moving beyond personal experience to collect and analyze data systematically and objectively. Relying only on personal experience is a hallmark of common sense.\n*   **1) it makes little distinction between the way the world is and the way it ought to be:** This is a characteristic of common sense, which is often filled with value judgments and opinions. Sociology, as a science, strives to be objective and describe the world as it *is*, rather than prescribing how it *ought to be*.\n*   **3) it is subjective and biased:** Again, this is a characteristic of common sense.
