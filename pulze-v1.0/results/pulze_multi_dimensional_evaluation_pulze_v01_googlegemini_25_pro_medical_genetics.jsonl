{"question": "### Question: The risk for miscarriage associated with amniocentesis is approximately ____. ### Choices: 0) 1 in 10 1) 1 in 50 2) 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 3) 1 in 1000", "gold_answer": "2", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **2) 1 in 100 to 1 in 200**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Amniocentesis** is an invasive prenatal diagnostic test that involves withdrawing a small amount of amniotic fluid. Because it is an invasive procedure, it carries a small risk of complications, the most serious of which is miscarriage.\n*   Historically, the widely quoted risk of miscarriage following amniocentesis was approximately **1 in 200 (0.5%)**. This figure is still commonly used in patient counseling and found in many textbooks. The range of **1 in 100 (1%) to 1 in 200 (0.5%)** encompasses this traditional estimate.\n*   It is important to note that more recent, large-scale studies suggest the procedure-related risk is actually lower, perhaps closer to **1 in 300 to 1 in 500**, or even less. This improvement is attributed to better techniques, such as the use of continuous ultrasound guidance.\n\nHowever, among the choices provided, **1 in 100 to 1 in 200** is the most classic and commonly cited approximation for this risk in a medical genetics context.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:52:16.949826+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "1f73c622-aba0-4cfb-ae91-7f268b058d35", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "18f57d62-d9b7-4d63-9e0a-66e8f696c16c", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

It is an inherited disorder characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon, which have a nearly 100% risk of progressing to colorectal cancer if not treated.\n*   **Li-Fraumeni syndrome:** This is a rare, inherited cancer predisposition syndrome. It significantly increases the risk of developing a wide range of cancers, often at a young age, including breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, and leukemia.\n*   **Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL):** This is a genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to a variety of benign and malignant tumors. It is particularly associated with an increased risk of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytomas, and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina.\n*   **Waardenburg syndrome:** This is a group of genetic conditions characterized by varying degrees of hearing loss and changes in the pigmentation of the hair, skin, and eyes.

This is a **deletion** of three DNA base pairs in the *CFTR* gene. This three-base-pair deletion results in the loss of a single amino acid, phenylalanine (F), at position 508 of the CFTR protein.

{"question": "### Question: Which of the following conditions shows anticipation in paternal transmission? ### Choices: 0) Huntington disease 1) Marfan syndrome 2) Cystic fibrosis 3) Fragile X syndrome", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **0) Huntington disease**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Anticipation** is a genetic phenomenon where the signs and symptoms of a condition become more severe and/or appear at an earlier age as it is passed from one generation to the next. This is typically caused by the expansion of unstable trinucleotide repeats in a gene.\n\n*   **Huntington disease** is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. It exhibits anticipation, and the repeat is particularly unstable during spermatogenesis (sperm formation). Therefore, large expansions, which lead to very early onset (juvenile Huntington disease), are almost always inherited from the **father (paternal transmission)**.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n\n*   **Marfan syndrome** and **Cystic fibrosis** are not trinucleotide repeat disorders and do not typically show anticipation.\n*   **Fragile X syndrome** is a trinucleotide repeat disorder and does show anticipation. However, the CGG repeat expansion occurs almost exclusively during oogenesis (egg formation). Therefore, anticipation in Fragile X syndrome is seen in **maternal transmission**, not paternal. A father with a premutation will pass it on to all his daughters without it expanding.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:46:43.976351+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "d13f9e96-ffeb-422a-a3bd-aa395b974b24", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "85bc5eae-8bed-4e67-a4fd-14035f805d74", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
