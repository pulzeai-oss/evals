{"question": "### Question: A group of scientists wanted to estimate the proportion of geese returning to the same site for the next breeding season. Suppose they decided to increase the sample size from 200 to 2,000. How will this affect the distribution of the sample proportion? ### Choices: 0) The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out. 1) The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out. 2) The spread of the distribution of the sample proportion will remain unaffected. 3) The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "Answer: 1) The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.\n\nExplanation: The standard error of p-hat is sqrt[p(1−p)/n].
