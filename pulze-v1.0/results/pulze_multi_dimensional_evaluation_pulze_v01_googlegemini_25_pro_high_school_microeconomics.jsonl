{"question": "### Question: Ray and Dorothy can both cook and can both pull weeds in the garden on a Saturday afternoon. For every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds. Based on this information, ### Choices: 0) Ray pulls weeds, since he has absolute advantage in cooking. 1) Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has absolute advantage in cooking. 2) Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking. 3) Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "Here's a step-by-step breakdown to find the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Concept of Opportunity Cost:** The information given tells us the opportunity cost of cooking for each person. Opportunity cost is what you give up to do something else.\n    *   For every hour Ray spends cooking, he gives up pulling 50 weeds. So, Ray's opportunity cost of one hour of cooking is 50 weeds.\n    *   For every hour Dorothy spends cooking, she gives up pulling 100 weeds. So, Dorothy's opportunity cost of one hour of cooking is 100 weeds.\n\n2.  **Determine Comparative Advantage:** A person has a comparative advantage in an activity if they have a lower opportunity cost for that activity.\n    *   **Cooking:** Ray's opportunity cost (50 weeds) is lower than Dorothy's (100 weeds). Therefore, **Ray has the comparative advantage in cooking.**\n    *   **Pulling Weeds:** To find the comparative advantage in pulling weeds, we can look at who has the higher opportunity cost in cooking. Since Dorothy gives up more weeds (100) to cook, it means she is relatively better at pulling weeds. Therefore, **Dorothy has the comparative advantage in pulling weeds.**\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle of Specialization:** For maximum efficiency and output, each person should specialize in the task in which they have a comparative advantage.\n    *   Ray should specialize in cooking.\n    *   Dorothy should specialize in pulling weeds.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Choices:**\n    *   0) Ray pulls weeds, since he has absolute advantage in cooking. (Incorrect. Ray should cook, and we can't determine absolute advantage.)\n    *   1) Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has absolute advantage in cooking. (Incorrect. The reason is wrong; specialization is based on comparative, not absolute, advantage.)\n    *   2) Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking. (Incorrect. Ray has the comparative advantage in cooking.)\n    *   3) **Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.** (Correct. Ray has the lower opportunity cost for cooking, so he has the comparative advantage and should be the one to cook.)\n\nThe correct choice is **3) Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.**", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:48:11.394760+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "02d24544-ecba-4f4a-8cf7-8c2b033d712a", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "fb119847-df8f-4ad6-968a-7e0da5485305", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: Every day Melanie spends her lunch money consuming apples, at $1 each, and oranges, at $2 each. At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility? ### Choices: 0) She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges. 1) She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. 2) She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. 3) She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both.", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "Here's a step-by-step breakdown to find the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to maximize total utility, which means getting the most satisfaction possible from a limited budget.\n\n2.  **Recall the Rule for Utility Maximization:** A consumer maximizes their utility when the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for all goods they consume. The formula is:\n    (Marginal Utility of Good A) / (Price of Good A) = (Marginal Utility of Good B) / (Price of Good B)\n    Or, MUa / Pa = MUb / Pb\n\n3.  **Apply the Rule to Melanie's Situation:**\n    *   **For Apples:**\n        *   Marginal Utility (MUa) = 12\n        *   Price (Pa) = $1\n        *   Marginal Utility per dollar = 12 / $1 = 12 utils per dollar.\n    *   **For Oranges:**\n        *   Marginal Utility (MUo) = 18\n        *   Price (Po) = $2\n        *   Marginal Utility per dollar = 18 / $2 = 9 utils per dollar.\n\n4.  **Compare the Results:**\n    *   Melanie gets 12 utils for her last dollar spent on apples.\n    *   She only gets 9 utils for her last dollar spent on oranges.\n    *   Since 12 > 9, she is not currently maximizing her utility. This eliminates choice 0.\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Action:** To increase her total utility, Melanie should reallocate her spending. She should spend less on the good that gives her lower \"bang for the buck\" (oranges) and more on the good that gives her higher \"bang for the buck\" (apples).\n\n    *   She should **decrease** her consumption of oranges.\n    *   She should **increase** her consumption of apples.\n\n6.  **Consider the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility:**\n    *   As she buys more apples, the marginal utility of the next apple will decrease (MUa will go down).\n    *   As she buys fewer oranges, the marginal utility of the last orange she gives up will be higher (MUo will go up).\n    *   She should continue to make this trade-off until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Choices:**\n    *   **Choice 1:** \"She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\" This perfectly matches our analysis.\n    *   **Choice 2:** This suggests the opposite action, which is incorrect.\n    *   **Choice 3:** This is a common mistake. The goal is not to make the marginal utilities equal, but the *marginal utility per dollar*.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **1**.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:23:03.607241+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "36bb6130-cead-4ced-8375-d9390e4d2dfa", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "fd95bbc6-4461-4544-b6e0-828ae2b994d1", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: Which of the following will increase wages for tuba makers? ### Choices: 0) An increase in the number of graduates at tuba maker training school 1) An increase in the price of tubas 2) An increase in the price of tuba lessons 3) An increase in the tax on tubas", "gold_answer": "1", "model_answer": "Here's a breakdown of why the correct answer is **1) An increase in the price of tubas**:\n\nThe wages of tuba makers are determined by the supply and demand for their labor. Let's analyze how each option affects this market:\n\n*   **0) An increase in the number of graduates at tuba maker training school:** This increases the **supply** of qualified tuba makers. When supply increases (and demand stays the same), the price (in this case, the wage) goes down.\n\n*   **1) An increase in the price of tubas:** The demand for tuba makers is a **derived demand**â€”it's derived from the demand for the product they make (tubas). If the price of tubas increases, it becomes more profitable for companies to produce and sell them. This increases the value of each tuba maker's output, leading companies to want to hire more of them. This increase in the **demand** for tuba makers will drive up their wages.\n\n*   **2) An increase in the price of tuba lessons:** Tuba lessons and tubas are **complements** (goods used together). If lessons become more expensive, fewer people will learn to play the tuba, which will decrease the demand for tubas. A lower demand for tubas means a lower demand for the workers who make them, leading to lower wages.\n\n*   **3) An increase in the tax on tubas:** A tax on tubas makes them more expensive for consumers, which will decrease the quantity demanded. With fewer tubas being sold, companies will need fewer tuba makers. This decreases the **demand** for tuba makers, leading to lower wages.\n\nTherefore, the only option that increases the demand for tuba makers and thus their wages is an increase in the price of the product they create.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:23:28.839729+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "4961882a-3683-494b-88cc-4f50278b36c4", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "bd4cea8c-b320-437e-9afd-cfcb23ebd47d", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
{"question": "### Question: The downward-sloping demand curve is partially explained by which of the following? ### Choices: 0) Substitution effects and income effects 1) The law of increasing marginal costs 2) The principle of comparative advantage 3) The law of diminishing marginal returns to production", "gold_answer": "0", "model_answer": "The correct answer is **0) Substitution effects and income effects**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\nThe downward-sloping demand curve illustrates the **Law of Demand**, which states that as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded for that good increases (and vice versa), all other things being equal. This relationship is explained by two main concepts:\n\n*   **Substitution Effect:** When the price of a good falls, it becomes relatively cheaper compared to other, similar goods (substitutes). Consumers will then substitute away from the more expensive goods and buy more of the good that is now cheaper.\n*   **Income Effect:** When the price of a good falls, a consumer's real income or purchasing power increases. They can now buy the same amount of the good as before and still have money left over. For most goods (called normal goods), this increase in real income leads to an increase in the quantity they purchase.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n\n*   **1) The law of increasing marginal costs:** This explains the upward-sloping *supply* curve, not the demand curve. It states that it costs more to produce each additional unit of a good.\n*   **2) The principle of comparative advantage:** This explains the gains from trade and specialization, not the relationship between price and quantity demanded for a single good.\n*   **3) The law of diminishing marginal returns to production:** This is a production concept that contributes to the law of increasing marginal costs and thus helps explain the shape of the *supply* curve.
