It refers to situations where countries actively sought American military presence, protection, and involvement rather than having it imposed upon them.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option 0: Voluntary reliance on an external power for security**\nThis accurately captures the essence of \"empire by invitation.\" Countries voluntarily invited American military bases, security guarantees, and protection, particularly in Western Europe after WWII. They sought this relationship for their own security interests, especially against the Soviet threat.\n\n**Option 1: Willful openness to colonization**\nThis is incorrect. \"Empire by invitation\" doesn't involve colonization in the traditional sense. Countries maintained their sovereignty and independence while seeking security partnerships.\n\n**Option 2: Cultural imperialism**\nWhile cultural influence may be a byproduct, this isn't what the term primarily means. It's specifically about security arrangements and military presence.\n\n**Option 3: Open advocacy of imperialism for economic gain**\nThis misses the point. The concept emphasizes that the \"invited\" power's presence was requested by host nations for security purposes, not openly advocated imperialism for economic exploitation.\n\n**The answer is 0: Voluntary reliance on an external power for security**", "answering_model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:30:54.824439+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "56353f7b-65c2-4e9c-82e1-a6ad1bbbfba3", "evaluation_run_id": "3f5f66c7-185e-4ea2-902a-2126c6cb389b", "dataset_item_id": "fd22edcd-4117-419f-b9a6-d492173d7435", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}
