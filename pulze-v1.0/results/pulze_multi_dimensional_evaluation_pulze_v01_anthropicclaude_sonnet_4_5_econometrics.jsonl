This is a common transformation technique when variance increases with the level of variables.\n\n**ii) Use suitably modified standard errors**\n- **Plausible**: YES\n- Heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors (White's standard errors or Huber-White sandwich estimators) correct for heteroscedasticity without changing coefficient estimates. This is one of the most common practical solutions.\n\n**iii) Use a generalised least squares procedure**\n- **Plausible**: YES\n- GLS (or Weighted Least Squares, WLS) is specifically designed to handle heteroscedasticity by weighting observations inversely to their variance. This produces efficient estimates when the form of heteroscedasticity is known or can be estimated.\n\n**iv) Add lagged values of the variables to the regression equation**\n- **Plausible**: NO\n- Adding lagged variables addresses **autocorrelation** (serial correlation in time series), not heteroscedasticity.

In hypothesis testing, the \"size\" of a test is defined as the probability of Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true), which is exactly what the significance level represents. Both are denoted by α.\n\n**(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test**\n\nThis is **INCORRECT**. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (1 - β, where β is the probability of Type II error). The significance level (α) and power (1 - β) are completely different concepts:\n- Significance level = P(reject H₀ | H₀ is true) = α\n- Power = P(reject H₀ | H₀ is false) = 1 - β\n\n**(iii) 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test**\n\nThis is **CORRECT**.
