{"question": "### Question: Given that $n > 1$, what is the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$? ### Choices: 0) 30 1) 64 2) 2048 3) 60", "gold_answer": "3", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the smallest positive integer $n > 1$ such that the product of its positive divisors equals $n^6$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for the product of divisors of a number\nFor a number $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ are their respective powers, the number of divisors is given by $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)...(a_k + 1)$. The product of the divisors is $n^{d/2}$, where $d = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)...(a_k + 1)$ is the number of divisors.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the condition for the product of divisors to be $n^6$\nGiven that the product of the divisors is $n^6$, we have $n^{d/2} = n^6$. This implies $d/2 = 6$, so $d = 12$. Thus, we are looking for a number $n$ such that the number of its divisors is 12.\n\n## Step 4: Express $d = 12$ in terms of the prime factorization of $n$\n$d = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)...(a_k + 1) = 12$. The number 12 can be factored as $12 = 1 \\times 12 = 2 \\times 6 = 3 \\times 4$. This gives us the possible combinations for the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$: $(a_1 + 1) = 12$, $(a_1 + 1) = 2$ and $(a_2 + 1) = 6$, or $(a_1 + 1) = 3$ and $(a_2 + 1) = 4$, and their permutations.\n\n## Step 5: Explore the possibilities for $n$ based on the factorization of $d = 12$\n1. For $d = 12$, we have $a_1 = 11$, so $n = p_1^{11}$. The smallest $n$ in this case is $2^{11} = 2048$.\n2. For $d = 2 \\times 6$, we have $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2 = 5$, so $n = p_1 \\cdot p_2^5$.

The smallest $n$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 = 8 \\cdot 9 = 72$.\n\n## Step 6: Check if there are other configurations for $d = 12$ with more than two prime factors\nFor $d = 12$, another configuration is $d = 1 \\times 1 \\times 12$, implying $n = p_1^{11}$, which we've considered. For $d = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3$, we have $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 1$, and $a_3 = 2$, so $n = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot p_3^2$. The smallest $n$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 = 150$.\n\n## Step 7: Compare the $n$ values obtained from different configurations\nWe have $n = 2048$ from $2^{11}$, $n = 486$ from $2 \\cdot 3^5$, $n = 72$ from $2^3 \\cdot 3^2$, and $n = 150$ from $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. We need to find the smallest $n$ among these.\n\n## Step 8: Identify the smallest $n$\nComparing the values: $72 < 150 < 486 < 2048$. So, $n = 72$ is not among the given choices, but it's the smallest. Let's check the given choices to see if any match our calculations or if we need to directly select from the given options.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the given choices\nThe given choices are 30, 64, 2048, and 60.

This is a valid candidate.\n\n## Step 10: Check if $n = 60$ or $n = 64$ satisfies the condition $n^6$\nFor $n = 60$, $d = 12$, so the product of divisors is $60^{12/2} = 60^6$, which matches the condition.\nFor $n = 64 = 2^6$, $d = 7$, so the product of divisors is $64^{7/2}$, not $64^6$.\n\nThe best answer is 3.", "answering_model": "groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct", "overall_score": 0.964, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:50:23.619476+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "99d58d99-47f4-4683-abdd-94f27d91255b", "evaluation_run_id": "a94adec5-27bf-46ac-b19a-e2cc1cc3bd3d", "dataset_item_id": "2e4a371a-96cd-4f61-8b23-72f1ccf9e994", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 9, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 8, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

This identity is derived from expanding $(a+b+c)^3$ and then subtracting $a^3 + b^3 + c^3$ from it.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the identity to simplify the given equation.\nUsing the identity, we have $3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150$.

One possible combination is when two of the sums are equal, which could simplify to $(a+b) = 2$, $(b+c) = 5$, and $(c+a) = 5$.\n\n## Step ## Step 6: Solve the system of equations derived from the factorization.\nLet's solve the system:\n1. $a + b = 2$\n2. $b + c = 5$\n3. $c + a = 5$\n\nFrom equation 1, we get $a = 2 - b$.
