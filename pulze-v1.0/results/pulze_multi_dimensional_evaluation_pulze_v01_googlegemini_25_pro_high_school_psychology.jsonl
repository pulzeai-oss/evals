These medications, such as Prozac, Zoloft, and Lexapro, work by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter **serotonin** in the brain. Serotonin is heavily involved in regulating mood, sleep, and appetite, and imbalances in this neurotransmitter are strongly linked to depression.\n\n*   **Dopamine** is more associated with the brain's reward and pleasure centers and is targeted by some antidepressants, but serotonin is the most common target.\n*   **Acetylcholine** is primarily involved in muscle action, learning, and memory.\n*   **Thorazine** is the brand name for an antipsychotic medication, not a neurotransmitter.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 1.0, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T20:48:30.211265+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "45fdc40f-adc5-40dd-a3bd-aca8353393ee", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "2304bf75-5815-4a91-9679-0915e8ebca03", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 10, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

This is a crucial detail. After two days, the information that was only in short-term memory (the last words on the list) will have faded away. The recency effect disappears. However, the words that were successfully transferred to long-term memory (the first words on the list) are much more likely to be remembered.\n\nTherefore, after a significant delay, only the primacy effect remains, meaning Dan would most likely remember the words from the **beginning of the list**.", "answering_model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro", "overall_score": 0.99, "label": "Correct Answer", "created_at": "2025-10-07T21:23:25.830067+00:00", "evaluation_result_id": "de6fb83e-fcbc-46d0-b083-f7cc3fc46ddf", "evaluation_run_id": "23bb4932-49f4-4274-9604-f8d9616aaa97", "dataset_item_id": "3b0a6785-4ad2-4024-bd8a-0b4a51b396bc", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d", "relevance": 10, "correctness": 10, "clarity": 10, "completeness": 10, "conciseness": 9, "appropriateness": 10, "helpfulness": 10}

A child's success or failure is seen as a direct reflection of the entire family.\n*   **Parental Responsibility in Education:** In Japan, there is immense societal pressure on parents, particularly mothers (often referred to as \"ky≈çiku mama\" or \"education mothers\"), to ensure their children's academic success. A child's failure in school would often be viewed as a failure of the parents to provide the right support, environment, and guidance.\n\nIn contrast, the United States, Canada, and England are more individualistic societies. While parents would certainly be concerned and involved, a 17-year-old is seen as nearing adulthood and is expected to take a significant amount of personal responsibility for their own academic performance.
