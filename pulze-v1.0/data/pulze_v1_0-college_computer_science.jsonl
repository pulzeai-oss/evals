{"question": "### Question: Which of the following considerations applies (apply) to choosing the page size in a paging system?\nI. An advantage of larger pages is that they lead to smaller page tables.\nII. An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation.\nIII. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously. ### Choices: 0) I only 1) II only 2) I and III only 3) I, II, and III", "answer": "3", "subject": "college_computer_science", "dataset_item_id": "1a8f1805-576c-44f8-b7bf-4036bc958d1c", "dataset_id": "d4af94bd-9272-453b-96e5-6ada99ba869b", "evaluation_run_id": "b55840b6-2f9a-40a0-9a2d-058758ffd906", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}
