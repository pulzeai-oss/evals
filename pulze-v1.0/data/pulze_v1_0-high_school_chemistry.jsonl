{"question": "### Question: A solution of a weak base is titrated with a solution of a standard strong acid. The progress of the titration is followed with a pH meter. Which of the following observations would occur? ### Choices: 0) Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point. 1) The pH of the solution gradually decreases throughout the experiment and the pH at the equivalence point is below 7. 2) Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH equal to 7 at the equivalence point. 3) Initially, the pH quickly decrease, then there is a gradual decrease to the equivalence point where the pOH equals the pKb of the base.", "answer": "0", "subject": "high_school_chemistry", "dataset_item_id": "e7cdccb3-6016-4281-9ddc-7426bfc3ff5e", "dataset_id": "d4af94bd-9272-453b-96e5-6ada99ba869b", "evaluation_run_id": "b55840b6-2f9a-40a0-9a2d-058758ffd906", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}
