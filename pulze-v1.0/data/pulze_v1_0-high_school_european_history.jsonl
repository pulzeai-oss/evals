{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nThe following excerpt is from a speech by Vladimir I. Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task—in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it—in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n—Vladimir I.

{"question": "### Question: This question refers to the following information.\nThe assumption by a government of the office of Reliever-general to the poor is necessarily forbidden by the principle that a government cannot rightly do anything more than protect. In demanding from a citizen contributions for the mitigation of distress … the state is … reversing its function. … To enforce the fundamental law—to take care that every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man. … [But that] is quite a separate thing from insuring him satisfaction. …\nThe poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong … are the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence. … When regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence.\nHerbert Spencer, Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind, 1851\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Spencer was an advocate of which nineteenth-century political philosophy? ### Choices: 0) Conservatism 1) Anarchism 2) Liberalism 3) Socialism", "answer": "2", "subject": "high_school_european_history", "dataset_item_id": "62b9b053-9544-40ef-af70-b55f005aaf26", "dataset_id": "d4af94bd-9272-453b-96e5-6ada99ba869b", "evaluation_run_id": "b55840b6-2f9a-40a0-9a2d-058758ffd906", "template_id": "7e007a06-fe5d-435d-8af6-4e5631d7fb4d"}

If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)\nIf the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799)\nThe presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal. (diary, 1801)\nMy power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)\nThe revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever.
