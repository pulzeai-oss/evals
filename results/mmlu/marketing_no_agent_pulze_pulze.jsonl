The key points of the weak theory align closely with the description in the question:\n\n   - It emphasizes retaining customers and increasing brand usage among existing customers.\n   - It focuses on reinforcing existing attitudes rather than drastically changing them.\n   - It views advertising as a defensive strategy to maintain market position.\n\n2) Strong theory (not the correct answer):\n   In contrast to the weak theory, the strong theory of advertising posits that advertising can create demand, change attitudes, and persuade consumers to take action.

It's often used for innovative or unique products that have no direct competitors. The high initial price allows the company to recoup development costs quickly and capitalize on early adopters willing to pay premium prices for new technology.\n\n1) Promotional pricing:\nThis strategy involves temporarily reducing prices to attract customers and increase sales. It's more commonly used for established products or to clear inventory, rather than for introducing new and unique products.\n\n2) Psychological pricing:\nThis strategy uses pricing techniques that appeal to consumers' emotions and perceptions, such as setting prices just below round numbers (e.g., $9.99 instead of $10). While it can be effective, it's not specifically tailored for new and unique product introductions.\n\n3) Penetration pricing:\nThis strategy involves setting a low initial price to quickly gain market share and attract a large customer base. It's often used in highly competitive markets or for products that aren't necessarily unique.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a new and unique product, the most appropriate pricing strategy would be price skimming (option 0).

This creates a unique interaction between the service provider and the customer.\n\n2. The question specifically mentions that services are \"produced and consumed by people, simultaneously, as a single event.\" This is a direct description of inseparability.\n\n3. The difficulty in standardizing service delivery, as mentioned in the question, is a direct result of this inseparability.

Primary data, on the other hand, is information collected firsthand by the researcher for a specific purpose.\n\nThe two main advantages of secondary data over primary data are:\n\n1.
